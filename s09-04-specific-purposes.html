    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_p01">Once you have chosen your general purpose and your topic, it’s time to take your speech to the next phase and develop your specific purpose. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">specific purpose</a><span class="glossdef">A statement starting with one of the three general purposes (to inform, to persuade, or to entertain), but is then followed by a specification of one’s audience, the actual topic a speaker has chosen, and the basic objective the speaker hopes to accomplish with the speech.</span></span> starts with one of the three general purposes and then specifies the actual topic you have chosen and the basic objective you hope to accomplish with your speech. Basically, the specific purpose answers the <em class="emphasis">who</em>, <em class="emphasis">what</em>, <em class="emphasis">when</em>, <em class="emphasis">where</em>, and <em class="emphasis">why</em> questions for your speech.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Getting Specific</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p01">When attempting to get at the core of your speech (the specific purpose), you need to know a few basic things about your speech. First, you need to have a general purpose. Once you know whether your goal is to inform, persuade, or entertain, picking an appropriate topic is easier. Obviously, depending on the general purpose, you will have a range of different types of topics. For example, let’s say you want to give a speech about hygiene. You could still give a speech about hygiene no matter what your general purpose is, but the specific purpose would vary depending on whether the general purpose is to inform (discussing hygiene practices around the globe), to persuade (discussing why people need to adopt a specific hygiene practice), or to entertain (discussing some of the strange and unique hygiene practices that people have used historically). Notice that in each of these cases, the general purpose alters the topic, but all three are still fundamentally about hygiene.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p02">Now, when discussing specific purposes, we are concerned with who, what, when, where, why, and how questions for your speech. Let’s examine each of these separately. First, you want to know who is going to be in your audience. Different audiences, as discussed in the chapter on audience analysis, have differing desires, backgrounds, and needs. Keeping your audience first and foremost in your thoughts when choosing a specific purpose will increase the likelihood that your audience will find your speech meaningful.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p03">Second is the “what” question, or the basic description of your topic. When picking an effective topic, you need to make sure that the topic is appropriate for a variety of constraints or limitations within a speaking context.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p04">Third, you need to consider when your speech will be given. Different speeches may be better for different times of the day. For example, explaining the importance of eating breakfast and providing people with cereal bars may be a great topic at 9:00 a.m. but may not have the same impact if you’re giving it at 4:00 p.m.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p05">Fourth, you need to consider where your speech will be given. Are you giving a speech in front of a classroom? A church? An executive meeting? Depending on the location of your speech, different topics may or may not be appropriate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p06">The last question you need to answer within your speech is why. Why does your audience need to hear your speech? If your audience doesn’t care about your specific purpose, they are less likely to attend to your speech. If it’s a topic that’s a little more off-the-wall, you’ll really need to think about why they should care.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p07">Once you’ve determined the <em class="emphasis">who</em>, <em class="emphasis">what</em>, <em class="emphasis">when</em>, <em class="emphasis">where</em>, and <em class="emphasis">why</em> aspects of your topic, it’s time to start creating your actual specific purpose. First, a specific purpose, in its written form, should be a short, declarative sentence that emphasizes the main topic of your speech. Let’s look at an example:</p>
        <div class="informaltable block" frame="all">
            <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Topic</td>
                        <td>The military</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Narrower Topic</td>
                        <td>The military’s use of embedded journalists</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Narrowed Topic</td>
                        <td>The death of British reporter Rupert Hamer in 2010 in a roadside bombing in Nawa, Afghanistan, along with five US Marines</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p08">In this example, we’ve quickly narrowed a topic from a more general topic to a more specific topic. Let’s now look at that topic in terms of a general purpose and specific purpose:</p>
        <div class="informaltable block" frame="all">
            <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>General Purpose</td>
                        <td>To inform</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Specific Purpose</td>
                        <td>To inform my audience about the danger of embedded journalism by focusing on the death of British reporter Rupert Hamer</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>General Purpose</td>
                        <td>To persuade</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Specific Purpose</td>
                        <td>To persuade a group of journalism students to avoid jobs as embedded journalists by using the death of British reporter Rupert Hamer as an example of what can happen</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p09">For the purpose of this example, we used the same general topic area, but demonstrated how you could easily turn the topic into either an informative speech or a persuasive speech. In the first example, the speaker is going to talk about the danger embedded journalists face. In this case, the speaker isn’t attempting to alter people’s ideas about embedded journalists, just make them more aware of the dangers. In the second case, the specific purpose is to persuade a group of journalism students (the audience) to avoid jobs as embedded journalists.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Your Specific Statement of Purpose</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s02_p01">To form a clear and succinct statement of the specific purpose of your speech, start by naming your general purpose (to inform, to persuade, or to entertain). Follow this by a capsule description of your audience (my peers in class, a group of kindergarten teachers, etc.). Then complete your statement of purpose with a prepositional phrase (a phrase using “to,” “about,” “by,” or another preposition) that summarizes your topic. As an example, “My specific purpose is to persuade the students in my residence hall to protest the proposed housing cost increase” is a specific statement of purpose, while “My speech will be about why we should protest the proposed housing cost increase” is not.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s02_p02">Specific purposes should be statements, not questions. If you find yourself starting to phrase your specific purpose as a question, ask yourself how you can reword it as a statement. <a class="xref" href="#wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s02_t01">Table 6.3 "My Specific Purpose Is…"</a> provides several more examples of good specific purpose statements.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Basic Tips for Creating Specific Purposes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_p01">Now that we’ve examined what specific purposes are, we are going to focus on a series of tips to help you write specific purposes that are appropriate for a range of speeches.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Audience, Audience, Audience</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_s01_p01">First and foremost, you always need to think about your intended audience when choosing your specific purpose. In the previous section, we talked about a speech where a speaker is attempting to persuade a group of journalism students to not take jobs as embedded journalists. Would the same speech be successful, or even appropriate, if given in your public speaking class? Probably not. As a speaker, you may think your topic is great, but you always need to make sure you think about your audience when selecting your specific purpose. For this reason, when writing your specific purpose, start off your sentence by including the words “my audience” or actually listing the name of your audience: a group of journalism students, the people in my congregation, my peers in class, and so on. When you place your audience first, you’re a lot more likely to have a successful speech.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Matching the Rhetorical Situation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_s02_p01">After your audience, the second most important consideration about your specific purpose pertains to the rhetorical situation of your speech. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rhetorical situation</a><span class="glossdef">The set of circumstances surrounding your speech (e.g., speaker, audience, text, and context).</span></span> is the set of circumstances surrounding your speech (e.g., speaker, audience, text, and context). When thinking about your specific purpose, you want to ensure that all these components go together. You want to make sure that you are the appropriate speaker for a topic, the topic is appropriate for your audience, the text of your speech is appropriate, and the speech is appropriate for the context. For example, speeches that you give in a classroom may not be appropriate in a religious context and vice versa.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Make It Clear</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_s03_p01">The specific purpose statement for any speech should be direct and not too broad, general, or vague. Consider the lack of clarity in the following specific purpose: “To persuade the students in my class to drink more.” Obviously, we have no idea what the speaker wants the audience to drink: water, milk, orange juice? Alcoholic beverages? Furthermore, we have no way to quantify or make sense of the word “more.” “More” assumes that the students are already drinking a certain amount, and the speaker wants them to increase their intake. If you want to persuade your listeners to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day, you need to say so clearly in your specific purpose.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_s03_p02">Another way in which purpose statements are sometimes unclear comes from the use of colloquial language. While we often use colloquialisms in everyday life, they are often understood only by a limited number of people. It may sound like fun to have a specific purpose like, “To persuade my audience to get jiggy,” but if you state this as your purpose, many people probably won’t know what you’re talking about at all.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Don’t Double Up</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_s04_p01">You cannot hope to solve the entire world’s problems in one speech, so don’t even try. At the same time, you also want to make sure that you stick to one specific purpose. Chances are it will be challenging enough to inform your audience about one topic or persuade them to change one behavior or opinion. Don’t put extra stress on yourself by adding topics. If you find yourself using the word “and” in your specific topic statement, you’re probably doubling up on topics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Can I Really Do This in Five to Seven Minutes?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_s05_p01">When choosing your specific purpose, it’s important to determine whether it can be realistically covered in the amount of time you have. Time limits are among the most common constraints for students in a public speaking course. Usually speeches early in the term have shorter time limits (three to five minutes), and speeches later in the term have longer time limits (five to eight minutes). While eight minutes may sound like an eternity to be standing up in front of the class, it’s actually a very short period of time in which to cover a topic. To determine whether you think you can accomplish your speech’s purpose in the time slot, ask yourself how long it would take to make you an informed person on your chosen topic or to persuade you to change your behavior or attitudes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_s05_p02">If you cannot reasonably see yourself becoming informed or persuaded during the allotted amount of time, chances are you aren’t going to inform or persuade your audience either. The solution, of course, is to make your topic narrower so that you can fully cover a limited aspect of it.</p>
