    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_p01">When considering how to use language effectively in your speech, consider the degree to which the language is appropriate, vivid, inclusive, and familiar. The next sections define each of these aspects of language and discuss why each is important in public speaking.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Use Appropriate Language</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p01">As with anything in life, there are positive and negative ways of using language. One of the first concepts a speaker needs to think about when looking at language use is appropriateness. By appropriate, we mean whether the language is suitable or fitting for ourselves, as the speaker; our audience; the speaking context; and the speech itself.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Appropriate for the Speaker</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s01_p01">One of the first questions to ask yourself is whether the language you plan on using in a speech fits with your own speaking pattern. Not all language choices are appropriate for all speakers. The language you select should be suitable for you, not someone else. If you’re a first-year college student, there’s no need to force yourself to sound like an astrophysicist even if you are giving a speech on new planets. One of the biggest mistakes novice speakers make is thinking that they have to use million-dollar words because it makes them sound smarter. Actually, million-dollar words don’t tend to function well in oral communication to begin with, so using them will probably make you uncomfortable as a speaker. Also, it may be difficult for you or the audience to understand the nuances of meaning when you use such words, so using them can increase the risk of denotative or connotative misunderstandings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Appropriate for the Audience</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p01">The second aspect of appropriateness asks whether the language you are choosing is appropriate for your specific audience. Let’s say that you’re an engineering student. If you’re giving a presentation in an engineering class, you can use language that other engineering students will know. On the other hand, if you use that engineering vocabulary in a public speaking class, many audience members will not understand you. As another example, if you are speaking about the Great Depression to an audience of young adults, you can’t assume they will know the meaning of terms like “New Deal” and “WPA,” which would be familiar to an audience of senior citizens. In other chapters of this book, we have explained the importance of audience analysis; once again, audience analysis is a key factor in choosing the language to use in a speech.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Appropriate for the Context</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s03_p01">The next question about appropriateness is whether the language you will use is suitable or fitting for the context itself. The language you may employ if you’re addressing a student assembly in a high school auditorium will differ from the language you would use at a business meeting in a hotel ballroom. If you’re giving a speech at an outdoor rally, you cannot use the same language you would use in a classroom. Recall that the speaking context includes the occasion, the time of day, the mood of the audience, and other factors in addition to the physical location. Take the entire speaking context into consideration when you make the language choices for your speech.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Appropriate for the Topic</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s04_p01">The fourth and final question about the appropriateness of language involves whether the language is appropriate for your specific topic. If you are speaking about the early years of The Walt Disney Company, would you want to refer to Walt Disney as a “thaumaturgic” individual (i.e., one who works wonders or miracles)? While the word “thaumaturgic” may be accurate, is it the most appropriate for the topic at hand? As another example, if your speech topic is the dual residence model of string theory, it makes sense to expect that you will use more sophisticated language than if your topic was a basic introduction to the physics of, say, sound or light waves.</p>

    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Use Vivid Language</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p01">After appropriateness, the second main guideline for using language is to use vivid language. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Vivid language</a><span class="glossdef">Language that helps a listener create strong, distinct, or clearly perceptible mental images.</span></span> helps your listeners create strong, distinct, clear, and memorable mental images. Good vivid language usage helps an audience member truly understand and imagine what a speaker is saying. Two common ways to make your speaking more vivid are through the use of imagery and rhythm.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Imagery</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Imagery</a><span class="glossdef">The use of language to represent objects, actions, or ideas.</span></span> is the use of language to represent objects, actions, or ideas. The goal of imagery is to help an audience member create a mental picture of what a speaker is saying. A speaker who uses imagery successfully will tap into one or more of the audience’s five basic senses (hearing, taste, touch, smell, and sight). Three common tools of imagery are concreteness, simile, and metaphor.</p>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Concreteness</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s01_p01">When we use language that is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">concrete</a><span class="glossdef">Language that helps an audience see specific realities or actual instances instead of abstract theories and ideas.</span></span>, we attempt to help our audiences see specific realities or actual instances instead of abstract theories and ideas. The goal of concreteness is to help you, as a speaker, show your audience something instead of just telling them. Imagine you’ve decided to give a speech on the importance of freedom. You could easily stand up and talk about the philosophical work of Rudolf Steiner, who divided the ideas of freedom into freedom of thought and freedom of action. If you’re like us, even reading that sentence can make you want to go to sleep. Instead of defining what those terms mean and discussing the philosophical merits of Steiner, you could use real examples where people’s freedom to think or freedom to behave has been stifled. For example, you could talk about how Afghani women under Taliban rule have been denied access to education, and how those seeking education have risked public flogging and even execution.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn13_012">Iacopino, V., &amp; Rasekh, Z. (1998). <em class="emphasis">The Taliban's war on women: A health and human rights crisis in Afghanistan</em>. Boston, MA: Physicians for Human Rights.</span> You could further illustrate how Afghani women under the Taliban are forced to adhere to rigid interpretations of Islamic law that functionally limit their behavior. As illustrations of the two freedoms discussed by Steiner, these examples make things more concrete for audience members and thus easier to remember. Ultimately, the goal of concreteness is to show an audience something instead of talking about it abstractly.</p>

            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s02">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Simile</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s02_p01">The second form of imagery is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">simile</a><span class="glossdef">Figure of speech in which two unlike things are explicitly compared using “like” or “as.”</span></span>. As you probably learned in English courses, a simile is a figure of speech in which two unlike things are explicitly compared. Both aspects being compared within a simile are able to remain separate within the comparison. The following are some examples:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s02_l01">
                    <li>The thunderous applause was <em class="emphasis">like</em> a party among the gods.</li>
                    <li>After the revelation, she was as angry <em class="emphasis">as</em> a raccoon caught in a cage.</li>
                    <li>Love is <em class="emphasis">like</em> a battlefield.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s02_p02">When we look at these two examples, you’ll see that two words have been italicized: “like” and “as.” All similes contain either “like” or “as” within the comparison. Speakers use similes to help an audience understand a specific characteristic being described within the speech. In the first example, we are connecting the type of applause being heard to something supernatural, so we can imagine that the applause was huge and enormous. Now think how you would envision the event if the simile likened the applause to a mime convention—your mental picture changes dramatically, doesn’t it?</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s02_p03">To effectively use similes within your speech, first look for instances where you may already be finding yourself using the words “like” or “as”—for example, “his breath smelled like a fishing boat on a hot summer day.” Second, when you find situations where you are comparing two things using “like” or “as,” examine what it is that you are actually comparing. For example, maybe you’re comparing someone’s breath to the odor of a fishing vessel. Lastly, once you see what two ideas you are comparing, check the mental picture for yourself. Are you getting the kind of mental image you desire? Is the image too strong? Is the image too weak? You can always alter the image to make it stronger or weaker depending on what your aim is.</p>

            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Metaphor</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_p01">The other commonly used form of imagery is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">metaphor</a><span class="glossdef">Figure of speech where a term or phrase is applied to something in a nonliteral way to suggest a resemblance.</span></span>, or a figure of speech where a term or phrase is applied to something in a nonliteral way to suggest a resemblance. In the case of a metaphor, one of the comparison items is said to <em class="emphasis">be</em> the other (even though this is realistically not possible). Let’s look at a few examples:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_l01">
                    <li>Love is a <em class="emphasis">battlefield</em>.</li>
                    <li>Upon hearing the charges, the accused <em class="emphasis">clammed up</em> and refused to speak without a lawyer.</li>
                    <li>Every year a new <em class="emphasis">crop</em> of activists are <em class="emphasis">born</em>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_p02">In these examples, the comparison word has been italicized. Let’s think through each of these examples. In the first one, the comparison is the same as one of our simile examples except that the word “like” is omitted—instead of being <em class="emphasis">like</em> a battlefield, the metaphor states that love <em class="emphasis">is</em> a battlefield, and it is understood that the speaker does not mean the comparison literally. In the second example, the accused “clams up,” which means that the accused refused to talk in the same way a clam’s shell is closed. In the third example, we refer to activists as “crops” that arise anew with each growing season, and we use “born” figuratively to indicate that they come into being—even though it is understood that they are not newborn infants at the time when they become activists.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_p03">To use a metaphor effectively, first determine what you are trying to describe. For example, maybe you are talking about a college catalog that offers a wide variety of courses. Second, identify what it is that you want to say about the object you are trying to describe. Depending on whether you want your audience to think of the catalog as good or bad, you’ll use different words to describe it. Lastly, identify the other object you want to compare the first one to, which should mirror the intentions in the second step. Let’s look at two possible metaphors:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_l02">
                    <li>Students <em class="emphasis">groped</em> their way through the <em class="emphasis">maze</em> of courses in the catalog.</li>
                    <li>Students <em class="emphasis">feasted on</em> the <em class="emphasis">abundance</em> of courses in the catalog.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_p04">While both of these examples evoke comparisons with the course catalog, the first example is clearly more negative and the second is more positive.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_p05">One mistake people often make in using metaphors is to make two incompatible comparisons in the same sentence or line of thought. Here is an example:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_l03">
                    <li>“That’s awfully thin gruel for the right wing to hang their hats on.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn13_013">Nordquist, R.

                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_p06">This is known as a mixed metaphor, and it often has an incongruous or even hilarious effect. Unless you are aiming to entertain your audience with fractured use of language, be careful to avoid mixed metaphors.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Rhythm</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p01">Our second guideline for effective language in a speech is to use rhythm. When most people think of rhythm, they immediately think about music. What they may not realize is that language is inherently musical; at least it can be. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Rhythm</a><span class="glossdef">The patterned, recurring variance of elements of sound or speech.</span></span> refers to the patterned, recurring variance of elements of sound or speech. Whether someone is striking a drum with a stick or standing in front of a group speaking, rhythm is an important aspect of human communication. Think about your favorite public speaker. If you analyze his or her speaking pattern, you’ll notice that there is a certain cadence to the speech. While much of this cadence is a result of the nonverbal components of speaking, some of the cadence comes from the language that is chosen as well. Let’s examine four types of rhythmic language: parallelism, repetition, alliteration, and assonance.</p>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Parallelism</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_s01_p01">When listing items in a sequence, audiences will respond more strongly when those ideas are presented in a grammatically parallel fashion, which is referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">parallelism</a><span class="glossdef">Presenting ideas in a grammatically parallel fashion.</span></span>. For example, look at the following two examples and determine which one sounds better to you:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_s01_l01">
                    <li>“Give me liberty or I’d rather die.”</li>
                    <li>“Give me liberty or give me death.”</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_s01_p02">Technically, you’re saying the same thing in both, but the second one has better rhythm, and this rhythm comes from the parallel construction of “give me.” The lack of parallelism in the first example makes the sentence sound disjointed and ineffective.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_s02">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Repetition</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_s02_p01">As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, one of the major differences between oral and written language is the use of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">repetition</a><span class="glossdef">The oral linguistic device where key words or phrases are repeated in an attempt to help audience members recall the words or phrases after the speech.</span></span>. Because speeches are communicated orally, audience members need to hear the core of the message repeated consistently. Repetition as a linguistic device is designed to help audiences become familiar with a short piece of the speech as they hear it over and over again. By repeating a phrase during a speech, you create a specific rhythm. Probably the most famous and memorable use of repetition within a speech is Martin Luther King Jr.’s use of “I have a dream” in his speech at the Lincoln Memorial on August 1963 during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. In that speech, Martin Luther King Jr. repeated the phrase “I have a dream” eight times to great effect.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_s03_p01">Another type of rhythmic language is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">alliteration</a><span class="glossdef">The repeating of two or more words in a series with the same consonant.</span></span>, or repeating two or more words in a series that begin with the same consonant. In the <em class="emphasis">Harry Potter</em> novel series, the author uses alliteration to name the four wizards who founded Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. There are two basic types of alliteration: immediate juxtaposition and nonimmediate juxtaposition. <em class="emphasis">Immediate juxtaposition</em> occurs when the consonants clearly follow one after the other—as we see in the <em class="emphasis">Harry Potter</em> example. <em class="emphasis">Nonimmediate juxtaposition</em> occurs when the consonants are repeated in nonadjacent words (e.g., “It is the <strong class="emphasis bold">p</strong>oison that we must <strong class="emphasis bold">p</strong>urge from our <strong class="emphasis bold">p</strong>olitics, the wall that we must tear down before the hour grows too late”).<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn13_014">Obama, B.

The following example is from Bill Clinton’s acceptance speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention: “Somewhere at this very moment, a child is <strong class="emphasis bold">b</strong>eing <strong class="emphasis bold">b</strong>orn in America.

The phrase “how now brown cow,” which elocution students traditionally used to learn to pronounce rounded vowel sounds, is an example of assonance. While rhymes like “free as a breeze,” “mad as a hatter,” and “no pain, no gain” are examples of assonance, speakers should be wary of relying on assonance because when it is overused it can quickly turn into bad poetry.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Gender-Specific Language</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_s01_p01">The first common form of noninclusive language is language that privileges one of the sexes over the other. There are three common problem areas that speakers run into while speaking: using “he” as generic, using “man” to mean all humans, and gender typing jobs.</p>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Generic “He”</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_s01_s01_p01">The generic “he” happens when a speaker labels all people within a group as “he” when in reality there is a mixed sex group involved. Consider the statement, “Every morning when an officer of the law puts on his badge, he risks his life to serve and protect his fellow citizens.” In this case, we have a police officer that is labeled as male four different times in one sentence. Obviously, both male and female police officers risk their lives when they put on their badges. A better way to word the sentence would be, “Every morning when officers of the law put on their badges, they risk their lives to serve and protect their fellow citizens.” Notice that in the better sentence, we made the subject plural (“officers”) and used neutral pronouns (“they” and “their”) to avoid the generic “he.”</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_s01_s02_p01">Traditionally, speakers of English have used terms like “man,” “mankind,” and (in casual contexts) “guys” when referring to both females and males. In the second half of the twentieth century, as society became more aware of gender bias in language, organizations like the National Council of Teachers of English developed guidelines for nonsexist language.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn13_016">National Council of Teachers of English (2002). <em class="emphasis">Guidelines for gender-fair use of language</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncte.org/positions/statements/genderfairuseoflang">http://www.ncte.org/positions/statements/genderfairuseoflang</a></span> For example, instead of using the word “man,” you could refer to the “human race.” Instead of saying, “hey, guys,” you could say, “OK, everyone.” By using gender-fair language you will be able to convey your meaning just as well, and you won’t risk alienating half of your audience.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_s01_s03_p01">The last common area where speakers get into trouble with gender and language has to do with job titles. It is not unusual for people to assume, for example, that doctors are male and nurses are female. As a result, they may say “she is a woman doctor” or “he is a male nurse” when mentioning someone’s occupation, perhaps not realizing that the statements “she is a doctor” and “he is a nurse” already inform the listener as to the sex of the person holding that job. Speakers sometimes also use a gender-specific pronoun to refer to an occupation that has both males and females. <a class="xref" href="#wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_s01_s03_t01">Table 13.1 "Gender Type Jobs"</a> lists some common gender-specific jobs titles along with more inclusive versions of those job titles.</p>

For example, within the United States we have numerous ethnic groups, including Italian Americans, Irish Americans, Japanese Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Cuban Americans, and Mexican Americans. As with the earlier example of “male nurse,” avoid statements such as “The committee is made up of four women and a Vietnamese man.” Instead, say, “The committee is made up of four women and a man” or, if race and ethnicity are central to the discussion, “The committee is made up of three European American women, an Israeli American woman, a Brazilian American woman, and a Vietnamese American man.” In recent years, there has been a trend toward steering inclusive language away from broad terms like “Asians” and “Hispanics” because these terms are not considered precise labels for the groups they actually represent. If you want to be safe, the best thing you can do is ask a couple of people who belong to an ethnic group how they prefer to label themselves.</p>

Notice also that we have used the phrase “members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender/transexual community” instead of the more clinical-sounding term “homosexual.”</p>
