    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_p01">The last type of entertaining speech we will examine is the keynote speech.

Keynotes are often given at the end of an event; there can also be a number of keynote speeches delivered throughout a longer event that lasts for several days. People who deliver keynote speeches are typically experts in a given area who are invited to speak at a conference, convention, banquet, meeting, or other kind of event for the purpose of setting a specific tone for the occasion. Some keynote speakers will actually work for a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">speakers bureau</a><span class="glossdef">Agency that represents celebrity and professional speakers.</span></span>, an agency that represents celebrity and professional speakers. One very important organization for all aspiring keynote speakers is the National Speaker’s Association (NSA, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nsaspeaker.org">http://www.nsaspeaker.org</a>). NSA also publishes a widely respected magazine for professional speakers called <em class="emphasis">Speaker</em> magazine, which can be accessed for free from their website (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nsaspeaker-magazine.org">http://www.nsaspeaker-magazine.org</a>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_p02">In the world of professional public speaking, there are two common types of keynotes: after-dinner speeches and motivational speeches. Let’s look at each of these unique speeches.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">After-Dinner Speaking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">After-dinner speaking</a><span class="glossdef">Speech that is informative or persuasive but also designed to elicit laughter from one’s audience.</span></span> gets its name from the idea that these speeches historically followed a meal of some kind. After-dinner speakers are generally asked to speak (or hired to speak) because they have the ability both to speak effectively and to make people laugh. First and foremost, after-dinner speeches are speeches and not stand-up comedy routines. All the basic conventions of public speaking previously discussed in this text apply to after-dinner speeches, but the overarching goal of these speeches is to be entertaining and to create an atmosphere of amusement.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p02">After-dinner speaking is probably the hardest type of speaking to do well because it is an entertaining speech that depends on the successful delivery of humor. People train for years to develop <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">comic timing</a><span class="glossdef">The verbal and nonverbal delivery that someone uses to enhance the comedic value of a message.</span></span>, or the verbal and nonverbal delivery used to enhance the comedic value of a message. But after-dinner speaking is difficult, not impossible. Here is the method we recommend for developing a successful after-dinner speech.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p03">First, use all that you have learned about informative or persuasive speeches to prepare a real informative or persuasive speech roughly two-thirds the length of what the final speech will become. That is, if you’re going to be giving a ten-minute speech, then your “real” informative or persuasive speech should be six or seven minutes in length.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p04">Next, go back through the speech and look for opportunities to insert humorous remarks. <a class="xref" href="#wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_t01">Table 18.1 "Forms of Verbal Humor"</a> lists various forms of verbal humor that are often used in the textual portion of a speech.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p05">Each of these is a possible humor device that could be implemented in a speech. Read the following speech delivered by Mark Twain on his seventieth birthday for a good example of an after-dinner speech (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/railton/onstage/70bday.html">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/railton/onstage/70bday.html</a>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p06">Once you’ve looked through your speech, examining places for verbal humor, think about any physical humor or props that would enhance your speech. Physical humor is great if you can pull it off without being self-conscious. One of the biggest mistakes any humorist makes is to become too aware of what his or her body is doing because it’s then harder to be free and funny. As for props, after-dinner speakers have been known to use everything from oversize inflatable baseball bats to rubber clown noses. The goal for a funny prop is that it adds to the humor of the speech without distracting from its message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p07">Last, and probably most important, try the humor out on real, live people. This is important for three reasons.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p08">First, the success of humor depends heavily on delivery, and especially timing in delivery. You will need practice to polish your delivery so that your humor comes across. If you can’t make it through one of your jokes without cracking up, you will need to either incorporate the self-crackup into your delivery or forgo using that joke.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p09">Second, just because you find something unbelievably funny in your head doesn’t mean that it will make anyone else laugh. Often, humor that we have written down on paper just doesn’t translate when orally presented. You may have a humorous story that you love reading on paper, but find that it just seems to drone on once you start telling it out loud. Furthermore, remember there is a difference between written and verbal language, and this also translates to how humor is interpreted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p10">Third, you need to make sure the humor you choose will be appropriate for a specific audience. What one audience finds funny another may find offensive. Humor is the double-edged sword of public speaking. On one side, it is an amazing and powerful speaking tool, but on the other side, few things will alienate an audience more than offensive humor. If you’re ever uncertain about whether a piece of humor will offend your audience, don’t use it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p11">The following are some other tips for using humor from people who have professionally given after-dinner speeches and learned the hard way what to do and what to avoid:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_l11">
            <li>Personalize or localize humor when possible.</li>
            <li>Be clear about which words need emphasis with verbal humor.</li>
            <li>Be sure the punch line is at the end. Don’t let on where the joke is going.</li>
            <li>Don’t announce, “This is funny.” or “I’m not very good at telling jokes, but…”</li>
            <li>Don’t try to use humor that you don’t know well.</li>
            <li>Don’t use humor that you personally don’t find funny.</li>
            <li>Don’t apologize if others don’t laugh.</li>
            <li>Don’t try to explain the humor if it fails—just move on.</li>
            <li>Don’t drag it out! Remember, brevity is the soul of wit.</li>
            <li>Know when to stop joking and be serious.</li>
            <li>Be natural and have fun!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Motivational Speaking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s02_p01">The second common form of keynote speaking is motivational speaking. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">motivational speech</a><span class="glossdef">Speech designed not only to make an audience experience an emotional arousal (fear, sadness, joy, excitement) but also to motivate the audience to do something with that arousal.</span></span> is designed not only to make an audience experience emotional arousal (fear, sadness, joy, excitement) but also to motivate the audience to do something with that emotional arousal. Whereas a traditional persuasive speech may want listeners to purchase product X or agree with ideology Y, a motivational speech helps to inspire people in a broader fashion, often without a clearly articulated end result in mind. As such, motivational speaking is a highly specialized form of persuasive speaking commonly delivered in schools, businesses, religious, and club or group contexts. <em class="emphasis">The Toastmasters International Guide to Successful Speaking</em> lists four types of motivational speeches: hero, survivor, religious, and success.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn18_001">Slutsky, J., &amp; Aun, M.

Just type “motivational speech” into YouTube and you’ll find many motivational speeches given by individuals who can be considered heroes or role models. The following clip presents a speech by Steve Sax, a former major league baseball player.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s03_s02_p04">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">survivor speech</a><span class="glossdef">Type of motivational speech given by someone who has survived a personal tragedy or has faced and overcome serious adversity.</span></span> is a speech given by someone who has survived a personal tragedy or who has faced and overcome serious adversity.

One highly sought-after religious speaker in the United States is Joel Osteen, head minister at Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas. In this clip, Joel is talking about finding and retaining joy in life.</p>
