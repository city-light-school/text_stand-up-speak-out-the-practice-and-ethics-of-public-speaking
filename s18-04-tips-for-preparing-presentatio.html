    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_p01">As we’ve seen earlier in this chapter, impressive presentation aids do not take the place of a well-prepared speech. Although your presentation aids should be able to stand on their own in delivering information, do not count on them to do so. Work toward that goal, but also plan on explaining your presentation aids so that your audience will know why you’re using them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_p02">One mistake you should avoid is putting too much information on an aid. You have to narrow the topic of your speech, and likewise, you must narrow the content of your presentation aids to match your speech. Your presentation aids should not represent every idea in your speech. Whatever presentation aids you choose to use, they should fulfill one or more of the functions described at the beginning of this chapter: to clarify or emphasize a point, to enhance retention and recall of your message, to add variety and interest to your speech, and to enhance your credibility as a speaker.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_p03">As a practical matter in terms of producing presentation aids, you may not be aware that many college campuses have a copy service or multimedia lab available to students for making copies, enlargements, slides, and other presentation aids. Find out from your instructor or a librarian what the resources on your campus are. In the rest of this section, we will offer some tips for designing good-quality presentation aids.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Easily Seen or Heard by Your Audience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s01_p01">The first rule of presentation aids is that they must be accessible for every audience member. If those in the back of the room cannot see, hear, or otherwise experience a presentation aid, then it is counterproductive to use it. Graphic elements in your presentation aids must be large enough to read. Audio must be loud enough to hear. If you are passing out samples of a food item for audience members to taste, you must bring enough for everyone.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s01_p02">Do not attempt to show your audience a picture by holding up a book open to the page with the photograph. Nobody will be able to see it. It will be too small for your listeners in the back of the room, and the light will glare off of the glossy paper usually used in books with color pictures so that the listeners in front won’t be able to see it either.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s01_p03">Text-based visuals, charts, and graphs need to be executed with strong, clean lines and blocks of color. Weak lines in a graph or illustration do not get stronger with magnification. You must either strengthen those lines by hand or choose another graphic element that has stronger lines. On a poster or a slide, a graphic element should take up about a third of the area. This leaves room for a small amount of text, rendered in a large, simple font. The textual elements should be located closest to the part of your graphic element that they are about.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s01_p04">Carefully limit the amount of text on a presentation aid. If a great deal of text is absolutely necessary, try to divide it between two slides or posters. Many students believe that even small text will magnify amply when it’s projected, but we find that this is rarely the case. We can’t recommend a specific point size because that refers to the distance between the baselines of two lines of text, not to the size of the type itself.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s01_p05">We recommend two things: First, use a simple, easy-to-read type style. It doesn’t have to be utterly devoid of style, but it should be readable and not distracting. Second, we recommend that you print your text in three or four sizes on a sheet of paper. Place the printed sheet on the floor and stand up. When you look at your printed sheet, you should be able to make a choice based on which clusters of type you are able to read from that distance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Easily Handled</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s02_p01">You should be able to carry your presentation aids into the room by yourself. In addition, you should be skilled in using the equipment you will use to present them. Your presentation aids should not distract you from the delivery of your speech.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Aesthetically Pleasing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_p01">For our purposes, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aesthetics</a><span class="glossdef">The beauty or good taste of a presentation aid.</span></span> refers to the beauty or good taste of a presentation aid. Earlier we mentioned the universal principles of good design: unity, emphasis or focal point, scale and proportion, balance, and rhythm. Because of wide differences in taste, not everyone will agree on what is aesthetically pleasing, and you may be someone who does not think of yourself as having much artistic talent. Still, if you keep these principles in mind, they will help you to create attractive, professional-looking visuals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_p02">The other aesthetic principle to keep in mind is that your presentation aids are intended to support your speech, not the other way around. The decisions you make in designing your visuals should be dictated by the content of your speech. If you use color, use it for a clear reason. If you use a border, keep it simple. Whatever you do, make certain that your presentation aids will be perceived as carefully planned and executed elements of your speech.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Tips for Text Aids</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s01_p01">Use text only when you must. For example, if you’re presenting an analysis of the First Amendment, it is permissible to display the text of the First Amendment, but not your entire analysis. The type must be big, simple, and bold. It needs white space around it to separate it from another graphic element or cluster of text that might be on the same presentation aid. When you display text, you must read it out loud before you go on to talk about it. That way, you won’t expect your listeners to read one thing while trying to listen to something else. However, under no circumstances should you merely read what’s on your text aids and consider that a speech.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Tips for Graphic Aids</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s02_p01">If you create your graphic images, you will have control over their size and the visible strength of the lines. However, you might want to show your listeners an illustration that you can’t create yourself. For instance, you might want to display a photograph of a portion of the Dead Sea Scrolls. First, find a way to enlarge the photograph. Then, to show integrity, cite your source. You should cite your source with an added caption, and you should also cite the source out loud as you display the graphic, even if your photograph is considered to be in the public domain. The NASA photograph “Spaceship Earth” is such an example. Many people use it without citing the source, but citing the source boosts your credibility as a speaker, and we strongly recommend doing so.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Rules for Computer Presentations</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_p01">Mark Stoner, a professor in the Department of Communication Studies at California State University, Sacramento, has written a useful assessment of the uses and abuses of PowerPoint. Stoner observes that</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_bl01">
                <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_p02">PowerPoint is a hybrid between the visual and the written. When we pay attention to the design of our writing—to whether we are putting key word at the beginning or end of a sentence, for instance—we are likely to communicate more effectively. In the same way, it makes sense to understand the impact that PowerPoint’s design has on our ability to communicate ideas to an audience.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn15_007">Stoner, M. (2007). Uncovering the powers within PowerPoint. <em class="emphasis">Communication Currents</em>, <em class="emphasis">2</em>(4). Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.natcom.org/CommCurrentsArticle.aspx?id=819">http://www.natcom.org/CommCurrentsArticle.aspx?id=819</a></span></p>
            </span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_p03">While this article is specifically about PowerPoint, Stoner’s advice works for all presentation software formats. Presentation aids should deliver information that is important or is difficult to present with spoken words only. Although many speakers attempt to put their entire speech on PowerPoint slides or other visual aids, this is a bad idea for several reasons. First, if you try to put your entire speech on PowerPoint, you will lose contact with your audience. Speakers often end up looking at the projected words or directly at the computer screen instead of at their audience. Second, your vocal delivery is likely to suffer, and you will end up giving a boring reading, not a dynamic speech. Third, you will lose credibility, as your listeners question how well you really know your topic. Fourth, you are not using the presentation aids to clarify or emphasize your message, so all the information may come across as equally important.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_p04">No matter what presentation software package you decide to utilize, there are some general guidelines you’ll need to follow.</p>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Watch Your Font</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s01_p01">One of the biggest mistakes novice users of presentational software make is thinking that if you can read it on the screen, your audience will be able to read it in their seats. While this may be the case if you’re in a close, intimate conference room, most of us will be speaking in situations where audience members are fifteen feet away or more. Make sure each slide is legible from the back of the room where you will be speaking.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Don’t Write Everything Out</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s02_p01">In addition to watching your font size, you also need to watch how you use words on the screen. Do not try to put too much information on a slide. Make sure that your slide has the appropriate information to support the point you are making and no more. We strongly recommend avoiding complete sentences on a slide unless you need to display a very important direct quotation.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Don’t Bow Down to the Software</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s03_p01">Remember, presentation software is an aid, so it should aid and not hinder your presentation. We have seen too many students who only end up reading the slides right off the screen instead of using the slides to enhance their presentations. When you read your slides right off the projector screen, you’re killing your eye contact. As a general word of advice, if you ever find yourself being forced to turn your back to the audience to read the screen, then you are not effectively using the technology. On the flip side, you also shouldn’t need to hide behind a computer monitor to see what’s being projected.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Slide Color</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s04_p01">Color is very important and can definitely make a strong impact on an audience. However, don’t go overboard or decide to use unappealing combinations of color. For example, you should never use a light font color (like yellow) on a solid white background because it’s hard for the eye to read.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s04_p02">You should also realize that while colors may be rich and vibrant on your computer screen at home, they may be distorted by a different monitor. While we definitely are in favor of experimenting with various color schemes, always check your presentation out on multiple computers to see if the slide color is being distorted in a way that makes it hard to read.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s05">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Slide Movement</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s05_p01">Everyone who has had an opportunity to experiment with PowerPoint knows that animation in transitions between slides or even on a single slide can be fun, but often people do not realize that too much movement can actually distract audience members. While all presentation software packages offer you very cool slide movements and other bells and whistles, they are not always very helpful for your presentation. If you’re going to utilize slide transitions or word animation, stick to only three or four different types of transitions in your whole presentation. Furthermore, do not have more than one type of movement on a given slide. If you’re going to have all your text come from the right side of the screen in a bulleted list, make sure that all the items on the bulleted list come from the right side of the screen.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Practice, Practice, Practice</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s06_p01">It is vital to practice using the technology. Nothing is worse than watching a speaker stand up and not know how to turn on the computer, access the software, or launch his or her presentation. When you use technology, audiences can quickly see if you know what you are doing, so don’t give them the opportunity to devalue your credibility because you can’t even get the show going.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Always Have a Backup Plan</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch15_s04_s04_p01">Lastly, always have a backup plan. Unfortunately, things often go wrong. One of the parts of being a professional is keeping the speech moving in spite of unexpected problems. Decide in advance what you will do if things break down or disappear right when you need them. Don’t count on your instructor to solve such predicaments; it is your responsibility. If you take this responsibility seriously and check the room where you will be presenting early, you will have time to adapt. If the computer or audiovisual setup does not work on the first try, you will need time to troubleshoot and solve the problem. If an easel is missing, you will need time to experiment with using a lectern or a chair to support your flip chart. If you forgot to bring your violin for a speech about music—don’t laugh, this actually happened to a friend of ours!—you will need time to think through how to adapt your speech so that it will still be effective.</p>
