    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_p01">Many entertaining speeches fall under the category of special-occasion speeches. All the speeches in this category are given to mark the significance of particular events. Common events include weddings, bar mitzvahs, awards ceremonies, funerals, and political events. In each of these different occasions, speakers are asked to deliver speeches relating to the event. For purposes of simplicity, we’ve broken special-occasion speeches into two groups: ceremonial speaking and inspirational speaking.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Ceremonial Speaking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Ceremonial speeches</a><span class="glossdef">Speeches given during a ceremony or a ritual marked by observance of formality or etiquette.</span></span> are speeches given during a ceremony or a ritual marked by observance of formality or etiquette. These ceremonies tend to be very special for people, so it shouldn’t be surprising that they are opportunities for speech making. Let’s examine each of the eight types of ceremonial speaking: introductions, presentations, acceptances, dedications, toasts, roasts, eulogies, and farewells.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Speeches of Introduction</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s01_p01">The first type of speech is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">speech of introduction</a><span class="glossdef">Speech given by the host of a ceremony that introduces another speaker and his or her speech.</span></span>, which is a minispeech given by the host of a ceremony that introduces another speaker and his or her speech. Few things are worse than when the introducer or a speaker stands up and says, “This is Joe Smith, he’s going to talk about stress.” While we did learn the speaker’s name and the topic, the introduction falls flat. Audiences won’t be the least bit excited about listening to Joe’s speech.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s01_p02">Just like any other speech, a speech of introduction should be a complete speech and have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion—and you should do it all in under two minutes. This brings up another “few things are worse” scenario: an introductory speaker who rambles on for too long or who talks about himself or herself instead of focusing on the person being introduced.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s01_p03">For an introduction, think of a hook that will make your audience interested in the upcoming speaker. Did you read a news article related to the speaker’s topic? Have you been impressed by a presentation you’ve heard the speaker give in the past? You need to find something that can grab the audience’s attention and make them excited about hearing the main speaker.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s01_p04">The body of your introductory speech should be devoted to telling the audience about the speaker’s topic, why the speaker is qualified, and why the audience should listen (notice we now have our three body points). First, tell your audience in general terms about the overarching topic of the speech. Most of the time as an introducer, you’ll only have a speech title and maybe a paragraph of information to help guide this part of your speech. That’s all right. You don’t need to know all the ins and outs of the main speaker’s speech; you just need to know enough to whet the audience’s appetite. Next, you need to tell the audience why the speaker is a credible speaker on the topic. Has the speaker written books or articles on the subject? Has the speaker had special life events that make him or her qualified? Lastly, you need to briefly explain to the audience why they should care about the upcoming speech.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s01_p05">The final part of a good introduction is the conclusion, which is generally designed to welcome the speaker to the lectern. Many introducers will conclude by saying something like, “I am looking forward to hearing how Joe Smith’s advice and wisdom can help all of us today, so please join me in welcoming Mr. Joe Smith.” We’ve known some presenters who will even add a notation to their notes to “start clapping” and “shake speakers hand” or “give speaker a hug” depending on the circumstances of the speech.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s01_p06">Now that we’ve walked through the basic parts of an introductory speech, let’s see one outlined:</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s01_p07"><em class="emphasis">Specific Purpose:</em> To entertain the audience while preparing them for Janice Wright’s speech on rituals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s01_p08"><em class="emphasis">Introduction:</em> Mention some common rituals people in the United States engage in (Christmas, sporting events, legal proceedings).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s01_p09"><em class="emphasis">Main Points:</em></p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s01_l01" numeration="upperroman">
                <li>Explain that the topic was selected because understanding how cultures use ritual is an important part of understanding what it means to be human.</li>
                <li>Janice Wright is a cultural anthropologist who studies the impact that everyday rituals have on communities.</li>
                <li>All of us engage in rituals, and we often don’t take the time to determine how these rituals were started and how they impact our daily routines.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s01_p10"><em class="emphasis">Conclusion:</em> I had the opportunity to listen to Dr. Wright at the regional conference in Springfield last month, and I am excited that I get to share her with all of you tonight. Please join me in welcoming Dr. Wright (start clapping, shake speaker’s hand, exit stage).</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Speeches of Presentation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s02_p01">The second type of common ceremonial speech is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">speech of presentation</a><span class="glossdef">Speech given by the awarder of a prize or honor.</span></span>. A speech of presentation is a brief speech given to accompany a prize or honor. Speeches of presentation can be as simple as saying, “This year’s recipient of the Schuman Public Speaking prize is Wilhelmina Jeffers,” or could last up to five minutes as the speaker explains why the honoree was chosen for the award.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s02_p02">When preparing a speech of presentation, it’s always important to ask how long the speech should be. Once you know the time limit, then you can set out to create the speech itself. First, you should explain what the award or honor is and why the presentation is important. Second, you can explain what the recipient has accomplished in order for the award to be bestowed. Did the person win a race? Did the person write an important piece of literature? Did the person mediate conflict? Whatever the recipient has done, you need to clearly highlight his or her work. Lastly, if the race or competition was conducted in a public forum and numerous people didn’t win, you may want to recognize those people for their efforts as well. While you don’t want to steal the show away from winner (as Kanye West did to Taylor Swift during the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards, for example <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/435995/taylor-swift-wins-best-female-video.jhtml#id=1620605">http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/435995/taylor-swift-wins-best-female-video.jhtml#id=1620605</a>), you may want to highlight the work of the other competitors or nominees.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Speeches of Acceptance</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s03_p01">The complement to a speech of presentation is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">speech of acceptance</a><span class="glossdef">Speech given by the recipient of a prize or honor.</span></span>. The speech of acceptance is a speech given by the recipient of a prize or honor. For example, in the above video clip from the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards, Taylor Swift starts by expressing her appreciation, gets interrupted by Kanye West, and ends by saying, “I would like to thank the fans and MTV, thank you.” While obviously not a traditional acceptance speech because of the interruption, she did manage to get in the important parts.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s03_p02">There are three typical components of a speech of acceptance: thank the givers of the award or honor, thank those who helped you achieve your goal, and put the award or honor into perspective. First, you want to thank the people who have given you the award or honor and possibly those who voted for you. We see this done every year during the Oscars, “First, I’d like to thank the academy and all the academy voters.” Second, you want to give credit to those who helped you achieve the award or honor. No person accomplishes things in life on his or her own. We all have families and friends and colleagues who support us and help us achieve what we do in life, and a speech of acceptance is a great time to graciously recognize those individuals. Lastly, put the award in perspective. Tell the people listening to your speech why the award is meaningful to you.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Speeches of Dedication</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s04_p01">The fourth ceremonial speech is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">speech of dedication</a><span class="glossdef">Speech delivered when a new store opens, a building is named after someone, a plaque is placed on a wall, when a new library is completed, and so on.</span></span>. A speech of dedication is delivered when a new store opens, a building is named after someone, a plaque is placed on a wall, a new library is completed, and so on. These speeches are designed to highlight the importance of the project and possibly those to whom the project has been dedicated. Maybe your great-uncle has died and left your college tons of money, so the college has decided to rename one of the dorms after your great-uncle. In this case, you may be asked to speak at the dedication.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s04_p02">When preparing the speech of dedication, start by explaining how you are involved in the dedication. If the person to whom the dedication is being made is a relative, tell the audience that the building is being named after your great-uncle who bestowed a gift to his alma mater. Second, you want to explain what is being dedicated. If the dedication is a new building or a preexisting building, you want to explain what is being dedicated and the importance of the structure. You should then explain who was involved in the project. If the project is a new structure, talk about the people who built the structure or designed it. If the project is a preexisting structure, talk about the people who put together and decided on the dedication. Lastly, explain why the structure is important for the community where it’s located. If the dedication is for a new store, talk about how the store will bring in new jobs and new shopping opportunities. If the dedication is for a new wing of a hospital, talk about how patients will be served and the advances in medicine the new wing will provide the community.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Toasts</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s05_p01">At one time or another, almost everyone is going to be asked to deliver a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">toast</a><span class="glossdef">Speech designed to congratulate, appreciate, or remember.</span></span>. A toast is a speech designed to congratulate, appreciate, or remember. First, toasts can be delivered for the purpose of congratulating someone for an honor, a new job, or getting married. You can also toast someone to show your appreciation for something they’ve done. Lastly, we toast people to remember them and what they have accomplished.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s05_p02">When preparing a toast, the first goal is always to keep your remarks brief. Toasts are generally given during the middle of some kind of festivities (e.g., wedding, retirement party, farewell party), and you don’t want your toast to take away from those festivities for too long. Second, the goal of a toast is to focus attention on the person or persons being toasted—not on the speaker. As such, while you are speaking you need to focus your attention to the people being toasted, both by physically looking at them and by keeping your message about them. You should also avoid any inside jokes between you and the people being toasted because toasts are public and should be accessible for everyone who hears them. To conclude a toast, simply say something like, “Please join me in recognizing Joan for her achievement” and lift your glass. When you lift your glass, this will signal to others to do the same and then you can all take a drink, which is the end of your speech.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s06">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Roasts</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s06_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">roast</a><span class="glossdef">Speech designed to both praise and good-naturedly insult a person being honored.</span></span> speech is a very interesting and peculiar speech because it is designed to both praise and good-naturedly insult a person being honored. Generally, roasts are given at the conclusion of a banquet in honor of someone’s life achievements. The television station Comedy Central has been conducting roasts of various celebrities for a few years.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s06_p02">In this clip, watch as Stephen Colbert, television host of <em class="emphasis">The Colbert Report</em>, roasts President George W. Bush.</p>
            <p class="para block"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSE_saVX_2A">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSE_saVX_2A</a></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s06_p03">Let’s pick this short clip apart. You’ll notice that the humor doesn’t pull any punches. The goal of the roast is to both praise and insult in a good-natured manner. You’ll also see that the roaster, in this case Stephen Colbert, is standing behind a lectern while the roastee, President George W. Bush, is clearly on display for the audience to see, and periodically you’ll see the camera pan to President Bush to take in his reactions. Half the fun of a good roast is watching the roastee’s reactions during the roast, so it’s important to have the roastee clearly visible by the audience.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s06_p04">How does one prepare for a roast? First, you want to really think about the person who is being roasted. Do they have any strange habits or amusing stories in their past that you can discuss? When you think through these things you want to make sure that you cross anything off your list that is truly private information or will really hurt the person. The goal of a roast is to poke at them, not massacre them. Second, when selecting which aspects to poke fun at, you need to make sure that the items you choose are widely known by your audience. Roasts work when the majority of people in the audience can relate to the jokes being made. If you have an inside joke with the roastee, bringing it up during roast may be great fun for the two of you, but it will leave your audience unimpressed. Lastly, end on a positive note. While the jokes are definitely the fun part of a roast, you should leave the roastee knowing that you truly do care about and appreciate the person.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s07">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Eulogies</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s07_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">eulogy</a><span class="glossdef">Speech given in honor of someone who has died.</span></span> is a speech given in honor of someone who has died. (Don’t confuse “eulogy” with “elegy,” a poem or song of mourning.) Unless you are a minister, priest, rabbi, imam, or other form of religious leader, you’ll probably not deliver too many eulogies in your lifetime. However, when the time comes to deliver a eulogy, it’s good to know what you’re doing and to adequately prepare your remarks. Watch the following clip of then-Senator Barack Obama delivering a eulogy at the funeral of civil rights activist Rosa Parks in November of 2005.</p>
            <p class="para block"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRsH92sJCr4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRsH92sJCr4</a></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s07_p02">In this eulogy, Senator Obama delivers the eulogy by recalling Rosa Parks importance and her legacy in American history.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s07_p03">When preparing a eulogy, first you need to know as much information about the deceased as possible. The more information you have about the person, the more personal you can make the eulogy. While you can rely on your own information if you were close to the deceased, it is always a good idea to ask friends and relatives of the deceased for their memories, as these may add important facets that may not have occurred to you. Of course, if you were not very close to the deceased, you will need to ask friends and family for information. Second, although eulogies are delivered on the serious and sad occasion of a funeral or memorial service for the deceased, it is very helpful to look for at least one point to be lighter or humorous. In some cultures, in fact, the friends and family attending the funeral will expect the eulogy to be highly entertaining and amusing. While eulogies are not roasts, one goal of the humor or lighter aspects of a eulogy is to relieve the tension that is created by the serious nature of the occasion. Lastly, remember to tell the deceased’s story. Tell the audience about who this person was and what the person stood for in life. The more personal you can make a eulogy, the more touching it will be for the deceased’s friends and families. The eulogy should remind the audience to celebrate the person’s life as well as mourn their death.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s08">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Speeches of Farewell</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s08_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">speech of farewell</a><span class="glossdef">Speech designed to allow someone to say good-bye to one part of his or her life as he or she is moving on to the next part of life.</span></span> allows someone to say good-bye to one part of his or her life as he or she is moving on to the next part of life. Maybe you’ve accepted a new job and are leaving your current job, or you’re graduating from college and entering the work force. Whatever the case may be, periods of transition are often marked by speeches of farewell. Watch the following clip of Derek Jeter’s 2008 speech saying farewell to Yankee Stadium, built in 1923, before the New York Yankees moved to the new stadium that opened in 2009.</p>
            <p class="para block"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJrlTpQm0to">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJrlTpQm0to</a></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s08_p02">In this speech, Derek Jeter is not only saying good-bye to Yankee Stadium but also thanking the fans for their continued support.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01_s08_p03">When preparing a speech of farewell, the goal should be to thank the people in your current position and let them know how much you appreciate them as you make the move to your next position in life. In Derek Jeter’s speech, he starts by talking about the history of the 1923 Yankee Stadium and then thanks the fans for their support. Second, you want to express to your audience how much the experience has meant to you. A farewell speech is a time to commemorate and think about the good times you’ve had. As such, you should avoid negativity during this speech. Lastly, you want to make sure that you end on a high note. Derek Jeter concludes his speech by saying, “On behalf of this entire organization, we just want to take this moment to salute you, the greatest fans in the world!” at which point Jeter and the other players take off their ball caps and hold them up toward the audience.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Inspirational Speaking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s02_p01">The goal of an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inspirational speech</a><span class="glossdef">Speech designed to elicit or arouse an emotional state within an audience.</span></span> is to elicit or arouse an emotional state within an audience. In <a class="xref" href="#wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s01">Section 18.2.1 "Ceremonial Speaking"</a>, we looked at ceremonial speeches. Although some inspirational speeches are sometimes tied to ceremonial occasions, there are also other speaking contexts that call for inspirational speeches. For our purposes, we are going to look at two types of inspirational speeches: goodwill and speeches of commencement.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Speeches to Ensure Goodwill</h2>

Although speeches of goodwill are clearly persuasive, they try not to be obvious about the persuasive intent and are often delivered as information-giving speeches that focus on an individual or organization’s positives attributes. There are three basic types of speeches of goodwill: public relations, justification, and apology.</p>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s02_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Speeches for Public Relations</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s02_s01_s01_p01">In a public relations speech, the speaker is speaking to enhance one’s own image or the image of his or her organization. You can almost think of these speeches as cheerleading speeches because the ultimate goal is to get people to like the speaker and what he or she represents. In the following brief speech, the CEO of British Petroleum is speaking to reporters about what his organization is doing during the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s02_s01_s02_p01">The second common speech of goodwill is the speech of justification, which is given when someone attempts to defend why certain actions were taken or will be taken. In these speeches, speakers have already enacted (or decided to enact) some kind of behavior, and are now attempting to justify why the behavior is or was appropriate. In the following clip, President Bill Clinton discusses his decision to bomb key Iraqi targets after uncovering a plot to assassinate former President George H. W. Bush.</p>

Again, the goal of this speech is to secure goodwill for President Clinton’s decisions both in the United States and on the world stage.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Speeches of Apology</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s02_s01_s03_p01">The final speech of goodwill is the speech of apology. Frankly, these speeches have become more and more commonplace. Every time we turn around, a politician, professional athlete, musician, or actor/actress is doing something reprehensible and getting caught. In fact, the speech of apology has quickly become a fodder for humor as well. Let’s take a look at a real apology speech delivered by professional golfer Tiger Woods.</p>
                <p class="para block"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs8nseNP4s0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs8nseNP4s0</a></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s02_s01_s03_p02">When you need to make an apology speech, there are three elements that you need to include: be honest and take responsibility, say you’re sorry, and offer restitution. First, a speaker needs to be honest and admit to doing something wrong. The worst apology speeches are those in which the individual tries to sidestep the wrongdoing. Even if you didn’t do anything wrong, it is often best to take responsibility from a public perception perspective. Second, say that you are sorry. People need to know that you are remorseful for what you’ve done. One of the problems many experts saw with Tiger Woods’s speech is that he doesn’t look remorseful at all. While the words coming out of his mouth are appropriate, he looks like a robot forced to read from a manuscript written by his press agent. Lastly, you need to offer restitution. Restitution can come in the form of fixing something broken or a promise not to engage in such behavior in the future. People in society are very willing to forgive and forget when they are asked.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Speeches for Commencements</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s02_s02_p01">The second type of inspirational speech is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">speech of commencement</a><span class="glossdef">Speech designed to recognize and celebrate the achievements of a group of people.</span></span>, which is designed to recognize and celebrate the achievements of a graduating class or other group of people. The most typical form of commencement speech happens when someone graduates from school. Nearly all of us have sat through commencement speeches at some point in our lives. And if you’re like us, you’ve heard good ones and bad ones. Numerous celebrities and politicians have been asked to deliver commencement speeches at colleges and universities. One famous and well-thought-out commencement speech was given by famed <em class="emphasis">Harry Potter</em> author J. K. Rowling at Harvard University in 2008.</p>
            <p class="para block"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkREt4ZB-ck">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkREt4ZB-ck</a></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s02_s02_p02">J. K. Rowling’s speech has the perfect balance of humor and inspiration, which are two of the main ingredients of a great commencement speech.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s02_s02_p03">If you’re ever asked to deliver a commencement speech, there are some key points to think through when deciding on your speech’s content.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>If there is a specific theme for the graduation, make sure that your commencement speech addresses that theme. If there is no specific theme, come up with one for your speech. Some common commencement speech themes are commitment, competitiveness, competence, confidence, decision making, discipline, ethics, failure (and overcoming failure), faith, generosity, integrity, involvement, leadership, learning, persistence, personal improvement, professionalism, reality, responsibility, and self-respect.</li>
                <li>Talk about your life and how graduates can learn from your experiences to avoid pitfalls or take advantages of life. How can your life inspire the graduates in their future endeavors?</li>
                <li>Make the speech humorous. Commencement speeches should be entertaining and make an audience laugh.</li>
                <li>Be brief! Nothing is more painful than a commencement speaker who drones on and on. Remember, the graduates are there to get their diplomas; their families are there to watch the graduates walk across the stage.</li>
                <li>Remember, while you may be the speaker, you’ve been asked to impart wisdom and advice for the people graduating and moving on with their lives, so keep it focused on them.</li>
                <li>Place the commencement speech into the broader context of the graduates’ lives. Show the graduates how the advice and wisdom you are offering can be utilized to make their own lives better.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s02_s02_p04">Overall, it’s important to make sure that you have fun when delivering a commencement speech. Remember, it’s a huge honor and responsibility to be asked to deliver a commencement speech, so take the time to really think through and prepare your speech.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="wrench_1.0-ch18_s02_s02_s02_l02">
                    <li>There are eight common forms of ceremonial speaking: introduction, presentation, acceptance, dedication, toast, roast, eulogy, and farewell. Speeches of introduction are designed to introduce a speaker. Speeches of presentation are given when an individual is presenting an award of some kind. Speeches of acceptance are delivered by the person receiving an award or honor. Speeches of dedication are given when a new building or other place is being opened for the first time. Toasts are given to acknowledge and honor someone on a special occasion (e.g., wedding, birthday, retirement). Roasts are speeches designed to both praise and good-naturedly insult a person being honored. Eulogies are given during funerals and memorial services. Lastly, speeches of farewell are delivered by an individual who is leaving a job, community, or organization, and wants to acknowledge how much the group has meant.</li>
                    <li>Inspirational speeches fall into two categories: goodwill (e.g., public relations, justification, and apology) and speeches of commencement. Speeches of goodwill attempt to get audience members to view the person or organization more favorably. On the other hand, speeches of commencement are delivered to recognize the achievements of a group of people.</li>
