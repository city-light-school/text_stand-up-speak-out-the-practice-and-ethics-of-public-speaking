    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_p01">As a student, you are exposed to many kinds of messages. You receive messages conveying academic information, institutional rules, instructions, and warnings; you also receive messages through political discourse, advertisements, gossip, jokes, song lyrics, text messages, invitations, web links, and all other manner of communication. You know it’s not all the same, but it isn’t always clear how to separate the truth from the messages that are misleading or even blatantly false. Nor is it always clear which messages are intended to help the listener and which ones are merely self-serving for the speaker. Part of being a good listener is to learn when to use caution in evaluating the messages we hear.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Critical listening</a><span class="glossdef">The process of examining claims made in a speech in order to assess their relevance and credibility.</span></span> in this context means using careful, systematic thinking and reasoning to see whether a message makes sense in light of factual evidence. Critical listening can be learned with practice but is not necessarily easy to do. Some people never learn this skill; instead, they take every message at face value even when those messages are in conflict with their knowledge. Problems occur when messages are repeated to others who have not yet developed the skills to discern the difference between a valid message and a mistaken one. Critical listening can be particularly difficult when the message is complex. Unfortunately, some speakers may make their messages intentionally complex to avoid critical scrutiny. For example, a city treasurer giving a budget presentation might use very large words and technical jargon, which make it difficult for listeners to understand the proposed budget and ask probing questions.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p01">Critical listening is first and foremost a skill that can be learned and improved. In this section, we are going to explore six different techniques you can use to become a more critical listener.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Recognizing the Difference between Facts and Opinions</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p01">Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan is credited with saying, “Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn04_011">Wikiquote. (n.d.). Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Daniel_Patrick_Moynihan">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Daniel_Patrick_Moynihan</a></span> Part of critical listening is learning to separate opinions from facts, and this works two ways: critical listeners are aware of whether a speaker is delivering a factual message or a message based on opinion, and they are also aware of the interplay between their own opinions and facts as they listen to messages.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p02">In American politics, the issue of health care reform is heavily laden with both opinions and facts, and it is extremely difficult to sort some of them out. A clash of fact versus opinion happened on September 9, 2010, during President Obama’s nationally televised speech to a joint session of Congress outlining his health care reform plan. In this speech, President Obama responded to several rumors about the plan, including the claim “that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false—the reforms I’m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.” At this point, one congressman yelled out, “You lie!” Clearly, this congressman did not have a very high opinion of either the health care reform plan or the president. However, when the nonpartisan watch group Factcheck.org examined the language of the proposed bill, they found that it had a section titled “No Federal Payment for Undocumented Aliens.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn04_012">Factcheck.org, a Project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.

            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p03">Often when people have a negative opinion about a topic, they are unwilling to accept facts. Instead, they question all aspects of the speech and have a negative predisposition toward both the speech and the speaker.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p04">This is not to say that speakers should not express their opinions. Many of the greatest speeches in history include personal opinions. Consider, for example, Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech, in which he expressed his personal wish for the future of American society. Critical listeners may agree or disagree with a speaker’s opinions, but the point is that they know when a message they are hearing is based on opinion and when it is factual.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Uncovering Assumptions</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s02_p01">If something is factual, supporting evidence exists. However, we still need to be careful about what evidence does and does not mean. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Assumptions</a><span class="glossdef">Assumptions are inferences we form in the absence of factual information. Some assumptions turn out to be accurate, but many are incomplete or just plain wrong.</span></span> are gaps in a logical sequence that listeners passively fill with their own ideas and opinions and may or may not be accurate. When listening to a public speech, you may find yourself being asked to assume something is a fact when in reality many people question that fact. For example, suppose you’re listening to a speech on weight loss. The speaker talks about how people who are overweight are simply not motivated or lack the self-discipline to lose weight. The speaker has built the speech on the assumption that motivation and self-discipline are the only reasons why people can’t lose weight. You may think to yourself, what about genetics? By listening critically, you will be more likely to notice unwarranted assumptions in a speech, which may prompt you to question the speaker if questions are taken or to do further research to examine the validity of the speaker’s assumptions. If, however, you sit passively by and let the speaker’s assumptions go unchallenged, you may find yourself persuaded by information that is not factual.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s02_p02">When you listen critically to a speech, you might hear information that appears unsupported by evidence. You shouldn’t accept that information unconditionally. You would accept it under the condition that the speaker offers credible evidence that directly supports it.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Be Open to New Ideas</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s03_p01">Sometimes people are so fully invested in their perceptions of the world that they are unable to listen receptively to messages that make sense and would be of great benefit to them. Human progress has been possible, sometimes against great odds, because of the mental curiosity and discernment of a few people. In the late 1700s when the technique of vaccination to prevent smallpox was introduced, it was opposed by both medical professionals and everyday citizens who staged public protests.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn04_013">Edward Jenner Museum. (n.d.). Vaccination. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jennermuseum.com/Jenner/vaccination.html">http://www.jennermuseum.com/Jenner/vaccination.html</a></span> More than two centuries later, vaccinations against smallpox, diphtheria, polio, and other infectious diseases have saved countless lives, yet popular opposition continues.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s03_p02">In the world of public speaking, we must be open to new ideas. Let’s face it, people have a tendency to filter out information they disagree with and to filter in information that supports what they already believe. Nicolaus Copernicus was a sixteenth-century astronomer who dared to publish a treatise explaining that the earth revolves around the sun, which was a violation of Catholic doctrine. Copernicus’s astronomical findings were labeled heretical and his treatise banned because a group of people at the time were not open to new ideas. In May of 2010, almost five hundred years after his death, the Roman Catholic Church admitted its error and reburied his remains with the full rites of Catholic burial.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn04_014">Owen, R. (2010, May 23). Catholic church reburies “heretic” Nicolaus Copernicus with honour. <em class="emphasis">Times Online</em>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s03_p03">While the Copernicus case is a fairly dramatic reversal, listeners should always be open to new ideas. We are not suggesting that you have to agree with every idea that you are faced with in life; rather, we are suggesting that you at least listen to the message and then evaluate the message.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Rely on Reason and Common Sense</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s04_p01">If you are listening to a speech and your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">common sense</a><span class="glossdef">Common sense in listening is an approach to considering the ideas in a speech. If the ideas seem to be consistent with each other and with daily reality, they might have merit. However, common sense in public speaking is not a substitute for factual evidence.</span></span> tells you that the message is illogical, you very well might be right. You should be thinking about whether the speech seems credible and coherent. In this way, your use of common sense can act as a warning system for you.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s04_p02">One of our coauthors once heard a speech on the environmental hazards of fireworks. The speaker argued that fireworks (the public kind, not the personal kind people buy and set off in their backyards) were environmentally hazardous because of litter. Although there is certainly some paper that makes it to the ground before burning up, the amount of litter created by fireworks displays is relatively small compared to other sources of litter, including trash left behind by all the spectators watching fireworks at public parks and other venues. It just does not make sense to identify a few bits of charred paper as a major environmental hazard.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s04_p03">If the message is inconsistent with things you already know, if the argument is illogical, or if the language is exaggerated, you should investigate the issues before accepting or rejecting the message. Often, you will not be able to take this step during the presentation of the message; it may take longer to collect enough knowledge to make that decision for yourself.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s04_p04">However, when you are the speaker, you should not substitute common sense for evidence. That’s why during a speech it’s necessary to cite the authority of scholars whose research is irrefutable, or at least highly credible. It is all too easy to make a mistake in reasoning, sometimes called fallacy, in stating your case. We will discuss these fallacies in more detail in <a class="xref" href="wrench_1.0-ch08#wrench_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Supporting Ideas and Building Arguments"</a>. One of the most common fallacies is <em class="emphasis">post hoc, ergo propter hoc</em>, a “common sense” form of logic that translates roughly as “after the fact, therefore because of the fact.” The argument says that if A happened first, followed by B, then A caused B. We know the outcome cannot occur earlier than the cause, but we also know that the two events might be related indirectly or that causality works in a different direction. For instance, imagine a speaker arguing that because the sun rises after a rooster’s crow, the rooster caused the sun to rise. This argument is clearly illogical because roosters crow many times each day, and the sun’s rising and setting do not change according to crowing or lack thereof. But the two events are related in a different way. Roosters tend to wake up and begin crowing at first light, about forty-five minutes before sunrise. Thus it is the impending sunrise that causes the predawn crowing.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s04_p05">In <a class="xref" href="wrench_1.0-ch02#wrench_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Ethics Matters: Understanding the Ethics of Public Speaking"</a>, we pointed out that what is “common sense” for people of one generation or culture may be quite the opposite for people of a different generation or culture. Thus it is important not to assume that your audience shares the beliefs that are, for you, common sense. Likewise, if the message of your speech is complex or controversial, you should consider the needs of your audience and do your best to explain its complexities factually and logically, not intuitively.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Relate New Ideas to Old Ones</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s05_p01">As both a speaker and a listener, one of the most important things you can do to understand a message is to relate new ideas to previously held ideas. Imagine you’re giving a speech about biological systems and you need to use the term “homeostasis,” which refers to the ability of an organism to maintain stability by making constant adjustments. To help your audience understand homeostasis, you could show how homeostasis is similar to adjustments made by the thermostats that keep our homes at a more or less even temperature. If you set your thermostat for seventy degrees and it gets hotter, the central cooling will kick in and cool your house down. If your house gets below seventy degrees, your heater will kick in and heat your house up. Notice that in both cases your thermostat is making constant adjustments to stay at seventy degrees. Explaining that the body’s homeostasis works in a similar way will make it more relevant to your listeners and will likely help them both understand and remember the idea because it links to something they have already experienced.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s05_p02">If you can make effective comparisons while you are listening, it can deepen your understanding of the message. If you can provide those comparisons for your listeners, you make it easier for them to give consideration to your ideas.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s06_p01">Note-taking is a skill that improves with practice. You already know that it’s nearly impossible to write down everything a speaker says. In fact, in your attempt to record everything, you might fall behind and wish you had divided your attention differently between writing and listening.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s06_p02">Careful, selective note-taking is important because we want an accurate record that reflects the meanings of the message. However much you might concentrate on the notes, you could inadvertently leave out an important word, such as <em class="emphasis">not</em>, and undermine the reliability of your otherwise carefully written notes. Instead, if you give the same care and attention to listening, you are less likely to make that kind of a mistake.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s06_p03">It’s important to find a balance between listening well and taking good notes. Many people struggle with this balance for a long time. For example, if you try to write down only key phrases instead of full sentences, you might find that you can’t remember how two ideas were related. In that case, too few notes were taken. At the opposite end, extensive note-taking can result in a loss of emphasis on the most important ideas.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s06_p04">To increase your critical listening skills, continue developing your ability to identify the central issues in messages so that you can take accurate notes that represent the meanings intended by the speaker.</p>
