        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is an Audience Analysis?</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s00_p01">One of the consequences of the First Amendment to the Constitution, which protects our right to speak freely, is that we focus so much on what we want to say that we often overlook the question of who our audience is. Does your audience care what you as a speaker think? Can they see how your speech applies to their lives and interests? The act of public speaking is a shared activity that involves interaction between speaker and audience. In order for your speech to get a fair hearing, you need to create a relationship with your listeners. Scholars Sprague, Stuart, and Bodary explain, “Speakers do not give speeches <em class="emphasis">to</em> audiences; they jointly create meaning <em class="emphasis">with</em> audiences.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_001">Sprague, J., Stuart, D., &amp; Bodary, D. (2010). <em class="emphasis">The speaker’s handbook</em> (9th ed.). Boston, MA: Wadsworth Cengage.</span> The success of your speech rests in large part on how your audience receives and understands it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s00_p02">Think of a time when you heard a speech that sounded “canned” or that fell flat because the audience didn’t “get it.” Chances are that this happened because the speaker neglected to consider that public speaking is an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">audience-centered</a><span class="glossdef">The emphasis of a speaker on the importance of the audience’s characteristics and needs.</span></span> activity. Worse, lack of consideration for one’s audience can result in the embarrassment of alienating listeners by telling a joke they don’t appreciate, or using language they find offensive. The best way to reduce the risk of such situations is to conduct an audience analysis as you prepare your speech.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s00_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Audience analysis</a><span class="glossdef">The process of gathering certain kinds of information about the people in your audience and using that information to understand the beliefs, values, needs, attitudes, and opinions they hold.</span></span> is the process of gathering information about the people in your audience so that you can understand their needs, expectations, beliefs, values, attitudes, and likely opinions. In this chapter, we will first examine some reasons why audience analysis is important. We will then describe three different types of audience analysis and some techniques to use in conducting audience analysis. Finally, we will explain how you can use your audience analysis not only during the creation of your speech but also while you are delivering it.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Acknowledge the Audience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01">Picture yourself in front of the audience, about to deliver your speech. This is the moment when your relationship with your audience begins, and the quality of this relationship will influence how receptive they will be to your ideas, or at least how willing they’ll be to listen to what you have to say. One of the best ways to initiate this relationship is by finding a way to acknowledge your audience. This can be as simple as establishing eye contact and thanking them for coming to hear your presentation. If they’ve braved bad weather, are missing a world-class sports event, or are putting up with an inconvenience such as a stuffy conference room, tell them how much you appreciate their presence in spite of the circumstances. This can go a long way toward getting them “on board” with your message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p02">For a political candidate who is traveling from town to town giving what may be perceived as the same campaign speech time and time again, a statement like “It’s great to be here in Springfield, and I want to thank the West Valley League of Women Voters and our hosts, the Downtown Senior Center, for the opportunity to be with you today” lets the audience know that the candidate has at least taken the trouble to tailor the speech to the present audience. Stephanie Coopman and James Lull tell us that Microsoft chairman Bill Gates often adapts to his audiences by thanking them for their participation in the computer industry or for their preparation to participate in an electronic world. The authors say, “Even those brief acknowledgments let audience members know that Gates had prepared his speech with them in mind.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_002">Coopman, S. J., &amp; Lull, J. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Public speaking: The evolving art</em>.

    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Choose a Worthwhile Topic</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p01">Your selection of a topic should reflect your regard for the audience. There is no universal list of good or bad topics, but you have an ethical responsibility to select a topic that will be worth listening to. As a student, you are probably sensitive to how unpleasant it would be to listen to a speech on a highly complex or technical topic that you found impossible to understand. However, have you considered that audiences do not want to waste their time or attention listening to a speech that is too simple? Many students find themselves tempted to choose an easy topic, or a topic they already know a great deal about. This is an understandable temptation; if you are like most students, you have many commitments and the demands on your time are considerable. Many experts encourage students to begin with something they already know. However, our experience tells us that students often do this simply to reduce their workload. For example, if the purpose of your speech is to inform or persuade students in your public speaking class, a topic such as fitness, drunk driving, the Greek system (campus fraternities and sororities), or credit card responsibility may be easy for you to address, but it is unlikely to go very far toward informing your audience, and in all likelihood, it will not be persuading them either. Instead, your audience members and your professor will quickly recognize that you were thinking of your own needs rather than those of your audience.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p02">To avoid this trap, it behooves you to seek a topic that will be novel and interesting both for you and for your audience. It will also be important to do some credible research in order to ensure that even the most informed audience members will learn something from you. There are many topics that could provide a refreshing departure from your usual academic studies. Topics such as the Bermuda Triangle, biopiracy, the environmental niche of sharks, the green lifestyle, and the historic Oneida Community all provide interesting views of human and natural phenomena not usually provided in public education. Such topics might be more likely to hold the interest of your classroom audience than topics they’ve heard about time and time again.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p03">You should be aware that your audience will not have the same set of knowledge that you do. For instance, if you are speaking about biopiracy, you should probably define it and give a clear example. If your speech is on the green lifestyle, it would be important to frame it as a realistic choice, not a goal so remote as to be hopeless. In each case, you should use audience analysis to consider how your audience will respond to you, your topic, and your message.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Clarity</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p01">Nothing is more lamentable than a rhetorical actor who endeavors to make grandiose the impressions of others through the utilization of an elephantine albeit nonsensical <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">argot</a><span class="glossdef">Specialized vocabulary or jargon of a particular profession or social group.</span></span>—or nothing is worse than a speaker who tries to impress the audience with a giant vocabulary that no one understands. In the first portion of the preceding sentence, we pulled out as many polysyllabic words as we could find. Unfortunately, most people will just find the sentence wordy and the meaning will pass right over their heads. As such, we as public speakers must ensure that we are clear in what we say.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p02">Make sure that you state your topic clearly at the outset, using words that your audience will understand. Letting them know what to expect from your speech shows consideration for them as listeners and lets them know that you value their time and attention.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p03">Throughout your speech, define your terms clearly and carefully in order to avoid misleading or alarming people by mistake. Be careful not to use jargon or “insider” language that will exclude listeners who aren’t “in the know.” If you approach audience analysis in haste, you might find yourself presenting a speech with no clear message. You might avoid making any statements outright from fear of offending. It is much better to know to whom you’re speaking and to present a clear, decisive message that lets listeners know what you think.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Controversial Topics Are Important and Risky</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p01">Some of the most interesting topics are controversial. They are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">controversial topics</a><span class="glossdef">Topics surrounded by diverse and deeply felt feelings and opinions.</span></span> because people have deeply felt values and beliefs on different sides of those topics. For instance, before you choose nuclear energy as your topic, investigate the many voices speaking out both in favor and against increasing its use. Many people perceive nuclear energy as a clean, reliable, and much-needed source of energy. Others say that even the mining of uranium is harmful to the environment, that we lack satisfactory solutions for storing nuclear waste, and that nuclear power plants are vulnerable to errors and attacks. Another group might view the issue economically, believing that industry needs nuclear energy. Engineers might believe that if the national grid could be modernized, we would have enough energy, and that we should strive to use and waste less energy until modernization is feasible. Some might feel deep concern about our reliance on foreign oil. Others might view nuclear energy as more tried-and-true than other alternatives. The topic is extremely controversial, and yet it is interesting and very important.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p02">You shouldn’t avoid controversy altogether, but you should choose your topic carefully. Moreover, how you treat your audience is just as important as how you treat your topic. If your audience has widely diverse views, take the time to acknowledge the concerns they have. Treat them as intelligent people, even if you don’t trust the completeness or the accuracy of their beliefs about your topic.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Adapt Your Speech to Audience Needs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p01">When preparing a speech for a classroom audience consisting of other students and your professor, you may feel that you know their interests and expectations fairly well. However, we learn public speaking in order to be able to address other audiences where we can do some good. In some cases, your audience might consist of young children who are not ready to accept the fact that a whale is not a fish or that the moon is always round even though it sometimes appears to be a crescent or a half circle. In other cases, your audience might include retirees living on fixed incomes and who therefore might not agree that raising local taxes is a vital “investment in the future.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p02">Even in an audience that appears to be <em class="emphasis">homogeneous</em>—composed of people who are very similar to one another—different listeners will understand the same ideas in different ways. Every member of every audience has his or her own <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">frame of reference</a><span class="glossdef">An individual’s unique set of perspectives, experience, knowledge, and values.</span></span>—the unique set of perspectives, experience, knowledge, and values belonging to every individual. An audience member who has been in a car accident caused by a drunk driver might not appreciate a lighthearted joke about barhopping. Similarly, stressing the importance of graduate school might be discouraging to audience members who don’t know whether they can even afford to stay in college to complete an undergraduate degree.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p03">These examples illustrate why audience analysis—the process of learning all you reasonably can about your audience—is so centrally important. Audience analysis includes consideration of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">demographic information</a><span class="glossdef">Information about the audience’s gender, age range, marital status, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other variables that can influence their frame of reference.</span></span>, such as the gender, age range, marital status, race, and ethnicity of the people in your audience. Another, perhaps less obvious, demographic factor is <em class="emphasis">socioeconomic status</em>, which refers to a combination of characteristics including income, wealth, level of education, and occupational prestige. Each of these dimensions gives you some information about which kinds of topics, and which aspects of various topics, will be well received.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p04">Suppose you are preparing to give an informative speech about early childhood health care. If your audience is a group of couples who have each recently had a new baby and who live in an affluent suburb, you can expect that they will be young adults with high socioeconomic status; they will likely be eager to know about the very best available health care for their children, whether they are healthy or have various medical problems. In contrast, if your audience is a group of nurses, they may differ in age, but will be similar in education and occupational prestige. They will already know quite a lot about the topic, so you will want to find an aspect that may be new for them, such as community health care resources for families with limited financial resources or for referring children with special needs. As another example, if you are addressing a city council committee that is considering whether to fund a children’s health care initiative, your audience is likely to have very mixed demographics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p05">Audience analysis also takes into account what market researchers call <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">psychographic information</a><span class="glossdef">The audience’s set of beliefs, values, religions, and life experiences.</span></span>, which is more personal and more difficult to predict than demographics. Psychographic information involves the beliefs, attitudes, and values that your audience members embrace. Respecting your audience means that you avoid offending, excluding, or trivializing the beliefs and values they hold. Returning to the topic of early childhood health care, you can expect new parents to be passionate about wanting the best for their child. The psychographics of a group of nurses would revolve around their professional competence and the need to provide “standard of care” for their patients. In a city council committee meeting, the topic of early childhood health care may be a highly personal and emotional issue for some of your listeners, while for others it may be strictly a matter of dollars and cents.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Consider Audience Diversity</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p01">Diversity is a key dimension of audience membership and, therefore, of audience analysis. While the term “diversity” is often used to refer to racial and ethnic minorities, it is important to realize that audiences can be diverse in many other ways as well. Being mindful of diversity means being respectful of all people and striving to avoid <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">racism</a><span class="glossdef">The assumption that one race is superior to another.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethnocentrism</a><span class="glossdef">The belief that one’s own culture is the standard to which other cultures should aspire.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sexism</a><span class="glossdef">The assumption that one sex is weaker, less intelligent, less competent, or less deserving than the other.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ageism</a><span class="glossdef">The attitude of valuing youth and devaluing age.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">elitism</a><span class="glossdef">The practice of thinking the best of those with the highest status and prestige and treating them preferentially.</span></span>, and other assumptions. An interesting “ism” that is not often mentioned is <em class="emphasis">chronocentrism</em>, or the assumption that people today are superior to people who lived in earlier eras.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_003">Russell, J. (1991). Inventing the flat earth. <em class="emphasis">History Today</em>, <em class="emphasis">41</em>(8), 13–19.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p02">Sociologists John R. Logan and Wenquan Zhang analyzed racial and ethnic diversity in US cities and observed a pattern that rewrites the traditional “rules” of neighborhood change.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_004">Logan, J. R., and Zhang, C. (2010). Global neighborhoods: New pathways to diversity and separation. <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Sociology</em>, <em class="emphasis">115</em>, 1069–1109.</span> Whereas in our grandparents’ day a racially mixed neighborhood was one with African American and white residents, in recent decades, many more people from a variety of Asian and Latin American countries have immigrated to the United States. As a result, many cities have neighborhoods that are richly diverse with Asian, Hispanic, and African American cultural influences as well as those of white European Americans. Each cultural group consists of people from many communities and occupations. Each cultural group came to the United States for different reasons and came from different communities and occupations within their original cultures. Even though it can be easy to assume that people from a culture are exactly like each other, we undermine our credibility when we create our message as though members of these cultures are carbon copies of each other.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p03">One of the author’s classes included two students from China. During a discussion of cultural similarity and difference, one remarked, “I thought we would have the same tastes in food because we are both from China, but she likes different spices and cooking techniques than I do.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p04">While race, ethnicity, and culture may be relatively visible aspects of diversity, there are many other aspects that are less obvious, so your audience is often more diverse than you might initially think. Suppose you are going to give a talk on pool safety to residents of a very affluent suburban community—will all your audience members be wealthy? No. There might be some who are unemployed, some who are behind on their mortgage payments, some who live in rented rooms, not to mention some who work as babysitters or housekeepers. Furthermore, if your listeners have some characteristic in common, it doesn’t mean that they all think alike. For instance, if your audience consists of people who are members of military families, don’t assume that they all have identical beliefs about national security. If there are many business students in your audience, don’t assume they all agree about the relative importance of ethics and profits. Instead, recognize that a range of opinion exists.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p05">This is where the <em class="emphasis">frame of reference</em> we mentioned earlier becomes an important concept. People have a wide variety of reasons for making the choices they make and for doing the things they do. For instance, a business student, while knowing that profitability is important, might have a strong interest in green lifestyles, low energy use, and alternative energy sources, areas of economic development that might require a great deal of investment before profits are realized. In fact, some business students may want to be involved in a paradigm shift away from “business as usual.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p06">These examples illustrate how important it is to use audience analysis to avoid <em class="emphasis">stereotyping</em>—taking for granted that people with a certain characteristic in common have the same likes, dislikes, values, and beliefs. All members of our audiences deserve to have the same sensitivity and the same respect extended to them as unique individuals. Respecting diversity is not merely a responsibility within public speaking; it should be a responsibility we strive to embrace in all our human interactions.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Avoid Offending Your Audience</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p01">It might seem obvious that speakers should use audience analysis to avoid making offensive remarks, but even very experienced speakers sometimes forget this basic rule. If you were an Anglo-American elected official addressing a Latino audience, would you make a joke about a Mexican American person’s name sounding similar to the name of a popular brand of tequila? In fact, a state governor did just that in June 2011. Not suprisingly, news organizations covering the event reported that the joke fell flat.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_005">Shahid, A. (2011, June 24).

We didn’t choose our race, ethnicity, sex, age, sexual orientation, intellectual potential, or appearance. We already know that jokes aimed at people because of their membership in these groups are not just politically incorrect but also ethically wrong.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p02">It is not only insensitive humor that can offend an audience. Speakers also need to be aware of language and nonverbal behaviors that state or imply a negative message about people based on their various membership groups. Examples include language that suggests that all scientists are men, that all relationships are heterosexual, or that all ethnic minorities are unpatriotic. By the same token, we should avoid embedding assumptions about people in our messages. Even the most subtle suggestion may not go unnoticed. For example, if, in your speech, you assume that elderly people are frail and expensively medicated, you may offend people whose elder loved ones do not conform in any way to your assumptions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p03">Scholars Samovar and McDaniel tell us that ethical language choices require four guidelines:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>Be accurate; present the facts accurately.</li>
                <li>Be aware of the emotional impact; make sure that you don’t manipulate feelings.</li>
                <li>Avoid hateful words; refrain from language that disparages or belittles people.</li>
                <li>Be sensitive to the audience; know how audience members prefer to be identified (e.g., Native American instead of Indian, women instead of girls, African American instead of black, disabled instead of crippled).<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_006">Samovar, L.

            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p04">If you alienate your audience, they will stop listening. They will refuse to accept your message, no matter how true or important it is. They might even become hostile.

Do you respect them as individual human beings? Do you respect them enough to serve their needs and interests? Is your topic relevant and appropriate for them? Is your approach honest and sensitive to their preexisting beliefs? Your ability to answer these questions in a constructive way must be based on the best demographic and psychographic information you can use to learn about your listeners.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_p02">The audience needs to know they can trust the speaker’s motivations, intentions, and knowledge. They must believe that the speaker has no hidden motives, will not manipulate or trick them, and has their best interests at heart.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_p03">In order to convey regard and respect for the audience, you must be sincere. You must examine the motives behind your topic choice, the true purpose of your speech, and your willingness to do the work of making sure the content of the speech is true and represents reality. This can be difficult for students who face time constraints and multiple demands on their efforts. However, the attitude you assume for this task represents, in part, the kind of professional, citizen, parent, and human being you want to be. Even if you’ve given this issue little thought up to now, you can examine your motives and the integrity of your research and message construction. Ethically, you should.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_p01">While audience analysis does not guarantee against errors in judgment, it will help you make good choices in topic, language, style of presentation, and other aspects of your speech. The more you know about your audience, the better you can serve their interests and needs. There are certainly limits to what we can learn through information collection, and we need to acknowledge that before making assumptions, but knowing how to gather and use information through audience analysis is an essential skill for successful speakers.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Demographic Analysis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p01">As indicated earlier, demographic information includes factors such as gender, age range, marital status, race and ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. In your public speaking class, you probably already know how many students are male and female, their approximate ages, and so forth. But how can you assess the demographics of an audience ahead of time if you have had no previous contact with them? In many cases, you can ask the person or organization that has invited you to speak; it’s likely that they can tell you a lot about the demographics of the people who are expected to come to hear you.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p02">Whatever method you use to gather demographics, exercise respect from the outset. For instance, if you are collecting information about whether audience members have ever been divorced, be aware that not everyone will want to answer your questions. You can’t require them to do so, and you may not make assumptions about their reluctance to discuss the topic. You must allow them their privacy.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Age</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s01_p01">There are certain things you can learn about an audience based on age. For instance, if your audience members are first-year college students, you can assume that they have grown up in the post-9/11 era and have limited memory of what life was like before the “war on terror.” If your audience includes people in their forties and fifties, it is likely they remember a time when people feared they would contract the AIDS virus from shaking hands or using a public restroom. People who are in their sixties today came of age during the 1960s, the era of the Vietnam War and a time of social confrontation and experimentation. They also have frames of reference that contribute to the way they think, but it may not be easy to predict which side of the issues they support.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Gender</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s02_p01">Gender can define human experience. Clearly, most women have had a different cultural experience from that of men within the same culture. Some women have found themselves excluded from certain careers. Some men have found themselves blamed for the limitations imposed on women. In books such as <em class="emphasis">You Just Don’t Understand</em> and <em class="emphasis">Talking from 9 to 5</em>, linguist Deborah Tannen has written extensively on differences between men’s and women’s communication styles. Tannen explains, “This is not to say that all women and all men, or all boys and girls, behave any one way. Many factors influence our styles, including regional and ethnic backgrounds, family experience and individual personality. But gender is a key factor, and understanding its influence can help clarify what happens when we talk.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_007">Tannen, D. (1994, December 11).

            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s02_p02">Marriage tends to impose additional roles on both men and women and divorce even more so, especially if there are children. Even if your audience consists of young adults who have not yet made occupational or marital commitments, they are still aware that gender and the choices they make about issues such as careers and relationships will influence their experience as adults.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Culture</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s03_p01">In past generations, Americans often used the metaphor of a “melting pot” to symbolize the assimilation of immigrants from various countries and cultures into a unified, harmonious “American people.” Today, we are aware of the limitations in that metaphor, and have largely replaced it with a multiculturalist view that describes the American fabric as a “patchwork” or a “mosaic.” We know that people who immigrate do not abandon their cultures of origin in order to conform to a standard American identity. In fact, cultural continuity is now viewed as a healthy source of identity.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s03_p02">We also know that subcultures and cocultures exist within and alongside larger cultural groups. For example, while we are aware that Native American people do not all embrace the same values, beliefs, and customs as mainstream white Americans, we also know that members of the Navajo nation have different values, beliefs, and customs from those of members of the Sioux or the Seneca. We know that African American people in urban centers like Detroit and Boston do not share the same cultural experiences as those living in rural Mississippi. Similarly, white Americans in San Francisco may be culturally rooted in the narrative of distant ancestors from Scotland, Italy, or Sweden or in the experience of having emigrated much more recently from Australia, Croatia, or Poland.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s03_p03">Not all cultural membership is visibly obvious. For example, people in German American and Italian American families have widely different sets of values and practices, yet others may not be able to differentiate members of these groups. Differences are what make each group interesting and are important sources of knowledge, perspectives, and creativity.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Religion</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s04_p01">There is wide variability in religion as well. The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found in a nationwide survey that 84 percent of Americans identify with at least one of a dozen major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, and others. Within Christianity alone, there are half a dozen categories including Roman Catholic, Mormon, Jehovah’s Witness, Orthodox (Greek and Russian), and a variety of Protestant denominations. Another 6 percent said they were unaffiliated but religious, meaning that only one American in ten is atheist, agnostic, or “nothing in particular.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_008">Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life. (2008, February). Summary of key findings. In <em class="emphasis">U.S. religious landscape survey</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://religions.pewforum.org/reports#">http://religions.pewforum.org/reports#</a></span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s04_p02">Even within a given denomination, a great deal of diversity can be found. For instance, among Roman Catholics alone, there are people who are devoutly religious, people who self-identify as Catholic but do not attend mass or engage in other religious practices, and others who faithfully make confession and attend mass but who openly question Papal doctrine on various issues. Catholicism among immigrants from the Caribbean and Brazil is often blended with indigenous religion or with religion imported from the west coast of Africa. It is very different from Catholicism in the Vatican.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s04_p03">The dimensions of diversity in the religion demographic are almost endless, and they are not limited by denomination. Imagine conducting an audience analysis of people belonging to an individual congregation rather than a denomination: even there, you will most likely find a multitude of variations that involve how one was brought up, adoption of a faith system as an adult, how strictly one observes religious practices, and so on.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s04_p04">Yet, even with these multiple facets, religion is still a meaningful demographic lens. It can be an indicator of probable patterns in family relationships, family size, and moral attitudes.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Group Membership</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s05_p01">In your classroom audience alone, there will be students from a variety of academic majors. Every major has its own set of values, goals, principles, and codes of ethics. A political science student preparing for law school might seem to have little in common with a student of music therapy, for instance. In addition, there are other group memberships that influence how audience members understand the world. Fraternities and sororities, sports teams, campus organizations, political parties, volunteerism, and cultural communities all provide people with ways of understanding the world as it is and as we think it should be.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s05_p02">Because public speaking audiences are very often members of one group or another, group membership is a useful and often easy to access facet of audience analysis. The more you know about the associations of your audience members, the better prepared you will be to tailor your speech to their interests, expectations, and needs.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s06">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Education</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s06_p01">Education is expensive, and people pursue education for many reasons. Some people seek to become educated, while others seek to earn professional credentials. Both are important motivations. If you know the education levels attained by members of your audience, you might not know their motivations, but you will know to what extent they could somehow afford the money for an education, afford the time to get an education, and survive educational demands successfully.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s06_p02">The kind of education is also important. For instance, an airplane mechanic undergoes a very different kind of education and training from that of an accountant or a software engineer. This means that not only the attained level of education but also the particular field is important in your understanding of your audience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s07">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Occupation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_s07_p01">People choose occupations for reasons of motivation and interest, but their occupations also influence their perceptions and their interests. There are many misconceptions about most occupations. For instance, many people believe that teachers work an eight-hour day and have summers off. When you ask teachers, however, you might be surprised to find out that they take work home with them for evenings and weekends, and during the summer, they may teach summer school as well as taking courses in order to keep up with new developments in their fields. But even if you don’t know those things, you would still know that teachers have had rigorous generalized and specialized qualifying education, that they have a complex set of responsibilities in the classroom and the institution, and that, to some extent, they have chosen a relatively low-paying occupation over such fields as law, advertising, media, fine and performing arts, or medicine. If your audience includes doctors and nurses, you know that you are speaking to people with differing but important philosophies of health and illness. Learning about those occupational realities is important in avoiding wrong assumptions and stereotypes. We insist that you not assume that nurses are merely doctors “lite.” Their skills, concerns, and responsibilities are almost entirely different, and both are crucially necessary to effective health care.</p>

    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Psychographic Analysis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p01">Earlier, we mentioned psychographic information, which includes such things as values, opinions, attitudes, and beliefs. Authors Grice and Skinner present a model in which values are the basis for beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_009">Grice, G. L., &amp; Skinner, J. F. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Mastering public speaking: The handbook</em> (7th ed.). Boston, MA: Pearson.</span> Values are the foundation of their pyramid model. They say, “A value expresses a judgment of what is desirable and undesirable, right and wrong, or good and evil. Values are usually stated in the form of a word or phrase. For example, most of us probably share the values of equality, freedom, honesty, fairness, justice, good health, and family. These values compose the principles or standards we use to judge and develop our beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p02">It is important to recognize that, while demographic information as discussed in <a class="xref" href="#wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s01">Section 5.2.1 "Demographic Analysis"</a> is fairly straightforward and verifiable, psychographic information is much less clear-cut. Two different people who both say they believe in equal educational opportunity may have very different interpretations of what “equal opportunity” means. People who say they don’t buy junk food may have very different standards for what specific kinds of foods are considered “junk food.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p03">We also acknowledge that people inherit some values from their family upbringing, cultural influences, and life experiences. The extent to which someone values family loyalty and obedience to parents, thrift, humility, and work may be determined by these influences more than by individual choice.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p04">Psychographic analysis can reveal preexisting notions that limit your audience’s frame of reference. By knowing about such notions ahead of time, you can address them in your speech. Audiences are likely to have two basic kinds of preexisting notions: those about the topic and those about the speaker.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Preexisting Notions about Your Topic</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p01">Many things are a great deal more complex than we realize. Media stereotypes often contribute to our oversimplifications. For instance, one of your authors, teaching public speaking in the past decade, was surprised to hear a student claim that “the hippies meant well, but they did it wrong.” Aside from the question of the “it” that was done wrong, there was a question about how little the student actually knew about the diverse hippy cultures and their aspirations. The student seemed unaware that some of “the hippies” were the forebears of such things as organic bakeries, natural food co-ops, urban gardens, recycling, alternative energy, wellness, and other arguably positive developments.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p02">It’s important to know your audience in order to make a rational judgment about how their views of your topic might be shaped. In speaking to an audience that might have differing definitions, you should take care to define your terms in a clear, honest way.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p03">At the opposite end from oversimplification is the level of sophistication your audience might embody. Your audience analysis should include factors that reveal it. Suppose you are speaking about trends in civil rights in the United States. You cannot pretend that advancement of civil rights is virtually complete nor can you claim that no progress has been made. It is likely that in a college classroom, the audience will know that although much progress has been made, there are still pockets of prejudice, discrimination, and violence. When you speak to an audience that is cognitively complex, your strategy must be different from one you would use for an audience that is less educated in the topic. With a cognitively complex audience, you must acknowledge the overall complexity while stating that your focus will be on only one dimension. With an audience that’s uninformed about your topic, that strategy in a persuasive speech could confuse them; they might well prefer a black-and-white message with no gray areas. You must decide whether it is ethical to represent your topic this way.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p04">When you prepare to do your audience analysis, include questions that reveal how much your audience already knows about your topic. Try to ascertain the existence of stereotyped, oversimplified, or prejudiced attitudes about it. This could make a difference in your choice of topic or in your approach to the audience and topic.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Preexisting Notions about You</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p01">People form opinions readily. For instance, we know that students form impressions of teachers the moment they walk into our classrooms on the first day. You get an immediate impression of our age, competence, and attitude simply from our appearance and nonverbal behavior. In addition, many have heard other students say what they think of us.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p02">The same is almost certainly true of you. But it’s not always easy to get others to be honest about their impressions of you. They’re likely to tell you what they think you want to hear. Sometimes, however, you do know what others think. They might think of you as a jock, a suit-wearing conservative, a nature lover, and so on. Based on these impressions, your audience might expect a boring speech, a shallow speech, a sermon, and so on. However, your concern should still be serving your audience’s needs and interests, not debunking their opinions of you or managing your image. In order to help them be receptive, you address their interests directly, and make sure they get an interesting, ethical speech.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Situational Analysis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_p01">The next type of analysis is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">situational audience analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Audience analysis that focuses on situational factors such as the size of the audience, the physical setting, and the disposition of the audience toward the topic, the speaker, and the occasion.</span></span> because it focuses on characteristics related to the specific speaking situation. The situational audience analysis can be divided into two main questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_l01">
            <li>How many people came to hear my speech and why are they here? What events, concerns, and needs motivated them to come? What is their interest level, and what else might be competing for their attention?</li>
            <li>What is the physical environment of the speaking situation? What is the size of the audience, layout of the room, existence of a podium or a microphone, and availability of digital media for visual aids? Are there any distractions, such as traffic noise?</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Audience Size</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_s01_p01">In a typical class, your audience is likely to consist of twenty to thirty listeners. This audience size gives you the latitude to be relatively informal within the bounds of good judgment. It isn’t too difficult to let each audience member feel as though you’re speaking to him or her. However, you would not become so informal that you allow your carefully prepared speech to lapse into shallow entertainment. With larger audiences, it’s more difficult to reach out to each listener, and your speech will tend to be more formal, staying more strictly within its careful outline. You will have to work harder to prepare visual and audio material that reaches the people sitting at the back of the room, including possibly using amplification.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Occasion</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_s02_p01">There are many occasions for speeches. Awards ceremonies, conventions and conferences, holidays, and other celebrations are some examples. However, there are also less joyful reasons for a speech, such as funerals, disasters, and the delivery of bad news. As always, there are likely to be mixed reactions. For instance, award ceremonies are good for community and institutional morale, but we wouldn’t be surprised to find at least a little resentment from listeners who feel deserving but were overlooked. Likewise, for a speech announcing bad news, it is likely that at least a few listeners will be glad the bad news wasn’t even worse. If your speech is to deliver bad news, it’s important to be honest but also to avoid traumatizing your audience. For instance, if you are a condominium board member speaking to a residents’ meeting after the building was damaged by a hurricane, you will need to provide accurate data about the extent of the damage and the anticipated cost and time required for repairs. At the same time, it would be needlessly upsetting to launch into a graphic description of injuries suffered by people, animals, and property in neighboring areas not connected to your condomium complex.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_s02_p02">Some of the most successful speeches benefit from situational analysis to identify audience concerns related to the occasion. For example, when the president of the United States gives the annual State of the Union address, the occasion calls for commenting on the condition of the nation and outlining the legislative agenda for the coming year. The speech could be a formality that would interest only “policy wonks,” or with the use of good situational audience analysis, it could be a popular event reinforcing the connection between the president and the American people. In January 2011, knowing that the United States’ economy was slowly recovering and that jobless rates were still very high, President Barack Obama and his staff knew that the focus of the speech had to be on jobs. Similarly, in January 2003, President George W. Bush’s State of the Union speech focused on the “war on terror” and his reasons for justifying the invasion of Iraq. If you look at the history of State of the Union Addresses, you’ll often find that the speeches are tailored to the political, social, and economic situations facing the United States at those times.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Voluntariness of Audience</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_s03_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">voluntary audience</a><span class="glossdef">An audience attending a speech of their own free will.</span></span> gathers because they want to hear the speech, attend the event, or participate in an event. A classroom audience, in contrast, is likely to be a captive audience. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Captive audiences</a><span class="glossdef">An audience that perceives little or no choice about attendance.</span></span> are required to be present or feel obligated to do so. Given the limited choices perceived, a captive audience might give only grudging attention. Even when there’s an element of choice, the likely consequences of nonattendance will keep audience members from leaving. The audience’s relative perception of choice increases the importance of holding their interest.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_s03_p02">Whether or not the audience members chose to be present, you want them to be interested in what you have to say. Almost any audience will be interested in a topic that pertains directly to them. However, your audience might also be receptive to topics that are indirectly or potentially pertinent to their lives. This means that if you choose a topic such as advances in the treatment of spinal cord injury or advances in green technology, you should do your best to show how these topics are potentially relevant to their lives or careers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_s03_p03">However, there are some topics that appeal to audience curiosity even when it seems there’s little chance of direct pertinence. For instance, topics such as Blackbeard the pirate or ceremonial tattoos among the Maori might pique the interests of various audiences. Depending on the instructions you get from your instructor, you can consider building an interesting message about something outside the daily foci of our attention.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_s04_p01">The physical setting can make or break even the best speeches, so it is important to exercise as much control as you can over it. In your classroom, conditions might not be ideal, but at least the setting is familiar. Still, you know your classroom from the perspective of an audience member, not a speaker standing in the front—which is why you should seek out any opporutunity to rehearse your speech during a minute when the room is empty. If you will be giving your presentation somewhere else, it is a good idea to visit the venue ahead of time if at all possible and make note of any factors that will affect how you present your speech. In any case, be sure to arrive well in advance of your speaking time so that you will have time to check that the microphone works, to test out any visual aids, and to request any needed adjustments in lighting, room ventilation, or other factors to eliminate distractions and make your audience more comfortable.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_p01">Now that we have described what audience analysis is and why it is important, let’s examine some details of how to conduct it. Exactly how can you learn about the people who will make up your audience?</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Direct Observation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_p01">One way to learn about people is to observe them. By observing nonverbal patterns of behavior, you can learn a great deal as long as you are careful how you interpret the behaviors. For instance, do people greet each other with a handshake, a hug, a smile, or a nod? Do members of opposite sexes make physical contact? Does the setting suggest more conservative behavior? By listening in on conversations, you can find out the issues that concern people. Are people in the campus center talking about political unrest in the Middle East? About concerns over future Pell Grant funding? We suggest that you consider the ethical dimensions of eavesdropping, however. Are you simply overhearing an open conversation, or are you prying into a highly personal or private discussion?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Interviews and Surveys</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p01">Because your demographic analysis will be limited to your most likely audience, your most accurate way to learn about them is to seek personal information through interviews and surveys. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interview</a><span class="glossdef">A one-on-one exchange in which you ask questions of a respondent.</span></span> is a one-on-one exchange in which you ask questions of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">respondent</a><span class="glossdef">Someone who responds to a survey, questionnaire, interview, or focus group.</span></span>, whereas a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">survey</a><span class="glossdef">A set of written questions with multiple-choice questions and/or open-ended questions.</span></span> is a set of questions administered to several—or, preferably, many—respondents. Interviews may be conducted face-to-face, by phone, or by written means, such as texting. They allow more in-depth discussion than surveys, and they are also more time consuming to conduct. Surveys are also sometimes conducted face-to-face or by phone, but online surveys are increasingly common. You may collect and tabulate survey results manually, or set up an automated online survey through the free or subscription portals of sites like Survey Monkey and Zoomerang. Using an online survey provides the advantage of keeping responses anonymous, which may increase your audience members’ willingness to participate and to answer personal questions. Surveys are an efficient way to collect information quickly; however, in contrast to interviews, they don’t allow for follow-up questions to help you understand why your respondent gave a certain answer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p02">When you use interviews and surveys, there are several important things to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>Make sure your interview and survey questions are directly related to your speech topic. Do not use interviews to delve into private areas of people’s lives. For instance, if your speech is about the debate between creationism and evolution, limit your questions to their opinions about that topic; do not meander into their beliefs about sexual behavior or their personal religious practices.</li>
            <li>Create and use a standard set of questions. If you “ad lib” your questions so that they are phrased differently for different interviewees, you will be comparing “apples and oranges” when you compare the responses you’ve obtained.</li>
            <li>Keep interviews and surveys short, or you could alienate your audience long before your speech is even outlined. Tell them the purpose of the interview or survey and make sure they understand that their participation is voluntary.</li>
            <li>Don’t rely on just a few respondents to inform you about your entire audience. In all likelihood, you have a cognitively diverse audience. In order to accurately identify trends, you will likely need to interview or survey at least ten to twenty people.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p03">In addition, when you conduct interviews and surveys, keep in mind that people are sometimes less than honest in describing their beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. This widely recognized weakness of interviews and survey research is known as <em class="emphasis">socially desirable responding</em>: the tendency to give responses that are considered socially acceptable. Marketing professor Ashok Lalwani divides socially desirable responding into two types: (1) impression management, or intentionally portraying oneself in a favorable light and (2) self-deceptive enhancement, or exaggerating one’s good qualities, often unconsciously.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_010">Lalwani, A. K. (2009, August). The distinct influence of cognitive busyness and need for closure on cultural differences in socially desirable responding. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Consumer Research</em>, <em class="emphasis">36</em>, 305–316. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://business.utsa.edu/marketing/files/phdpapers/lalwani2_2009-jcr.pdf">http://business.utsa.edu/marketing/files/phdpapers/lalwani2_2009-jcr.pdf</a></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p04">You can reduce the effects of socially desirable responding by choosing your questions carefully. As marketing consultant Terry Vavra advises, “one should never ask what one can’t logically expect respondents to honestly reveal.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_011">Vavra, T. G. (2009, June 14). The truth about truth in survey research.

    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Focus Groups</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">focus group</a><span class="glossdef">A group of three to eight people who meet together to respond to questions asked by the researcher. A focus group is usually an anonymous group and their responses can be freewheeling. With permission, their discussion can be recorded.</span></span> is a small group of people who give you feedback about their perceptions. As with interviews and surveys, in a focus group you should use a limited list of carefully prepared questions designed to get at the information you need to understand their beliefs, attitudes, and values specifically related to your topic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_p02">If you conduct a focus group, part of your task will be striking a balance between allowing the discussion to flow freely according to what group members have to say and keeping the group focused on the questions. It’s also your job to guide the group in maintaining responsible and respectful behavior toward each other.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_p03">In evaluating focus group feedback, do your best to be receptive to what people had to say, whether or not it conforms to what you expected. Your purpose in conducting the group was to understand group members’ beliefs, attitudes, and values about your topic, not to confirm your assumptions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Existing Data about Your Audience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_p01">Occasionally, existing information will be available about your audience. For instance, if you have a student audience, it might not be difficult to find out what their academic majors are. You might also be able to find out their degree of investment in their educations; for instance, you could reasonably assume that the seniors in the audience have been successful students who have invested at least three years pursuing a higher education. Sophomores have at least survived their first year but may not have matched the seniors in demonstrating strong values toward education and the work ethic necessary to earn a degree.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_p02">In another kind of an audience, you might be able to learn other significant facts. For instance, are they veterans? Are they retired teachers? Are they members of a voluntary civic organization such as the Lions Club or Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD)? This kind of information should help you respond to their concerns and interests.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_p03">In other cases, you may be able to use demographics collected by public and private organizations. Demographic analysis is done by the US Census Bureau through the American Community Survey, which is conducted every year, and through other specialized demographic surveys.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_012">Bureau of the Census.

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s04_p01">A good audience analysis takes time, thought, preparation, implementation, and processing. If done well, it will yield information that will help you interact effectively with your audience. Professional speakers, corporate executives, sales associates, and entertainers all rely on audience analysis to connect with their listeners. So do political candidates, whose chances of gaining votes depend on crafting the message and mood to appeal to each specific audience. One audience might be preoccupied with jobs, another with property taxes, and another with crime. Similarly, your audience analysis should help you identify the interests of your audience. Ultimately, a successful audience analysis can guide you in preparing the basic content of your speech and help you adjust your speech “on the fly.”</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Prepare Content with Your Audience in Mind</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p01">The first thing a good audience analysis can do is help you focus your content for your specific audience. If you are planning on a delivering a persuasive speech on why people should become vegans and you find out through analysis that half of your audience are daughters and sons of cattle ranchers, you need to carefully think through your approach to the content. Maybe you’ll need to tweak your topic to focus on just the benefits of veganism without trying to persuade the audience explicitly. The last thing you want to do as a speaker is stand before an audience who is highly negative toward your topic before you ever open your mouth. While there will always be some naysayers in any audience, if you think through your topic with your audience in mind, you may be able to find a topic that will be both interesting to you as a speaker and beneficial to your audience as well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p02">In addition to adjusting the topic of your speech prior to the speaking event, you can also use your audience analysis to help ensure that the content of your speech will be as clear and understandable as humanly possible. We can use our audience analysis to help sure that we are clear.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p03">One area of clarity to be careful of is the use of idioms your audience may not know. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">idiom</a><span class="glossdef">A word or phrase where the meaning cannot be predicted from normal, dictionary definitions.</span></span> is a word or phrase where the meaning cannot be predicted from normal, dictionary definitions. Many idioms are culturally or temporally based. For example, the phrase “according to Hoyle” indicates that something is done “by the book” or “by the rules,” as in “These measurements aren’t according to Hoyle, but they’re close enough to give a general idea.” Most of us have no clue who Hoyle was or what this idiom means. It refers to Edmond Hoyle, who wrote some of the most popular card-playing rule books back in the 1700s in England. Today, card game enthusiasts may understand the intent of “according to Hoyle,” but for most people it no longer carries specific meaning. When thinking about your speech, be careful not to accidentally use idioms that you find commonplace but your audience may not.</p>

    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Adjusting Your Speech Based on Your Analysis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p01">In addition to using audience analysis to help formulate speech content, we can also use our audience analysis to make adjustments during the actual speech. These adjustments can pertain to the audience and to the physical setting.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p02">The feedback you receive from your audience during your speech is a valuable indication of ways to adjust your presentation. If you’re speaking after lunch and notice audience members looking drowsy, you can make adjustments to liven up the tone of your speech. You could use humor. You could raise your voice slightly. You could pose some questions and ask for a show of hands to get your listeners actively involved. As another example, you may notice from frowns and headshaking that some listeners aren’t convinced by the arguments you are presenting. In this case, you could spend more time on a specific area of your speech and provide more evidence than you originally intended. Good speakers can learn a lot by watching their audience while speaking and then make specific adjustments to both the content and delivery of the speech to enhance the speech’s ultimate impact.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p03">The second kind of adjustment has to do with the physical setting for your speech. For example, your situational analysis may reveal that you’ll be speaking in a large auditorium when you had expected a nice, cozy conference room. If you’ve created visual aids for a small, intimate environment, you may have to omit it, or tell your listeners that they can view it after the presentation. You may also need to account for a microphone. If you’re lucky enough to have a cordless microphone, then you won’t have to make too many adjustments to your speaking style. If, on the other hand, the microphone is corded or is attached to an unmovable podium, you’ll have to make adjustments to how you deliver the presentation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p04">In preparing a speech about wealth distribution in the United States, one of our students had the opposite problem. Anticipating a large room, she had planned to use a one-hundred-foot tape measure to illustrate the percentage of the nation’s wealth owned by the top one-fifth of the population. However, when she arrived she found that the room was only twelve by twenty feet, so that she had to walk back and forth zigzagging the tape from end to end to stretch out one hundred feet. Had she thought more creatively about how to adapt to the physical setting, she could have changed her plans to use just ten feet of the tape measure to symbolize 100 percent of the wealth. We will discuss the physical setting further in <a class="xref" href="wrench_1.0-ch14#wrench_1.0-ch14">Chapter 14 "Delivering the Speech"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s05_p01"><em class="emphasis">You’ve got to be kidding me</em>, Fatima thought to herself as she received the e-mail from her boss. She reread the e-mail hoping that something would change on the screen: “Fatima, I need you to prepare a presentation on what our company has done in the past year for Mrs. Jorgensen. She’s old, keep it simple. Leave out any of the complex material because it will probably just bore her anyways.—John.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s05_p02">Fatima joined R &amp; R Consulting right after Anthony Jorgensen, the founder and CEO, had passed away. While Penelope Jorgensen inherited the major stake in the firm and was still listed as the firm’s CEO, the day-to-day running of operations was given to John Preston, the chief operating officer.</p>
        <p class="para" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s05_p03">Fatima stared at her screen and wondered to what extent she should follow John’s advice and “keep it simple.” She’d only met Mrs. Jorgensen twice, but she’d always seemed to be pretty knowledgeable about the inner workings of the firm. Sure Mrs. Jorgensen wasn’t an expert in the field, but should she be treated like a helpless little old lady? <em class="emphasis">Not only is that sexist, it’s completely ageist! On the other hand, John’s words may have been chosen poorly, but maybe all Mrs. Jorgensen really wanted was a quick snapshot of what’s going on here</em>?</p>
        <p class="para" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s05_p04">Fatima sat in silence for a few minutes, opened up PowerPoint, and just stared at her monitor trying to figure out the best way to proceed.</p>
