    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s00">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Welcome to Informative Speaking</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s00_p01">An informative speech conveys knowledge, a task that you’ve engaged in throughout your life. When you give driving directions, you convey knowledge. When you caution someone about crossing the street at a certain intersection, you are describing a dangerous situation. When you steer someone away from using the car pool lane, you are explaining what it’s for.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s00_p02">When your professors greet you on the first day of a new academic term, they typically hand out a course syllabus, which informs you about the objectives and expectations of the course. Much of the information comes to have greater meaning as you actually encounter your coursework. Why doesn’t the professor explain those meanings on the first day? He or she probably does, but in all likelihood, the explanation won’t really make sense at the time because you don’t yet have the supporting knowledge to put it in context.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s00_p03">However, it is still important that the orientation information be offered. It is likely to answer some specific questions, such as the following: Am I prepared to take this course? Is a textbook required? Will the course involve a great deal of writing? Does the professor have office hours? The answers to these questions should be of central importance to all the students. These orientations are informative because they give important information relevant to the course.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s00_p04">An informative speech does not attempt to convince the audience that one thing is better than another. It does not advocate a course of action. Let’s say, for instance, that you have carefully followed the news about BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Let’s further say that you felt outraged by the sequence of events that led to the spill and, even more so, by its consequences. Consider carefully whether this is a good topic for your informative speech. If your speech describes the process of offshore oil exploration, it will be informative. However, if it expresses your views on what petroleum corporations <em class="emphasis">should</em> do to safeguard their personnel and the environment, save that topic for a persuasive speech.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s00_p05">Being honest about your private agenda in choosing a topic is important. It is not always easy to discern a clear line between informative and persuasive speech. Good information has a strong tendency to be persuasive, and persuasion relies on good information. Thus informative and persuasive speaking do overlap. It remains up to you to examine your real motives in choosing your topic. As we have said in various ways, ethical speaking means respecting the intelligence of your audience. If you try to circumvent the purpose of the informative speech in order to plant a persuasive seed, your listeners will notice. Such strategies often come across as dishonest.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">16.1</span> Informative Speaking Goals</h2>
    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_l01">
            <li>Explain the importance of accuracy, clarity, and listener interest in informative speaking.</li>
            <li>Discuss why speaking to inform is important. Identify strategies for making information clear and interesting to your speaking audience.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_p01">A good informative speech conveys accurate information to the audience in a way that is clear and that keeps the listener interested in the topic. Achieving all three of these goals—accuracy, clarity, and interest—is the key to your effectiveness as a speaker. If information is inaccurate, incomplete, or unclear, it will be of limited usefulness to the audience. There is no topic about which you can give complete information, and therefore, we strongly recommend careful narrowing. With a carefully narrowed topic and purpose, it is possible to give an accurate picture that isn’t misleading.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_p02">Part of being accurate is making sure that your information is current. Even if you know a great deal about your topic or wrote a good paper on the topic in a high school course, you need to verify the accuracy and completeness of what you know. Most people understand that technology changes rapidly, so you need to update your information almost constantly, but the same is true for topics that, on the surface, may seem to require less updating. For example, the American Civil War occurred 150 years ago, but contemporary research still offers new and emerging theories about the causes of the war and its long-term effects. So even with a topic that seems to be unchanging, you need to carefully check your information to be sure it’s accurate and up to date.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_p03">In order for your listeners to benefit from your speech, you must convey your ideas in a fashion that your audience can understand. The clarity of your speech relies on logical organization and understandable word choices. You should not assume that something that’s obvious to you will also be obvious to the members of your audience. Formulate your work with the objective of being understood in all details, and rehearse your speech in front of peers who will tell you whether the information in your speech makes sense.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_p04">In addition to being clear, your speech should be interesting. Your listeners will benefit the most if they can give sustained attention to the speech, and this is unlikely to happen if they are bored. This often means you will decide against using some of the topics you know a great deal about. Suppose, for example, that you had a summer job as a veterinary assistant and learned a great deal about canine parasites. This topic might be very interesting to you, but how interesting will it be to others in your class? In order to make it interesting, you will need to find a way to connect it with their interests and curiosities. Perhaps there are certain canine parasites that also pose risks to humans—this might be a connection that would increase audience interest in your topic.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Why We Speak to Inform</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s01_p01">Informative speaking is a means for the delivery of knowledge. In informative speaking, we avoid expressing opinion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s01_p02">This doesn’t mean you may not speak about controversial topics. However, if you do so, you must deliver a fair statement of each side of the issue in debate. If your speech is about standardized educational testing, you must honestly represent the views both of its proponents and of its critics. You must not take sides, and you must not slant your explanation of the debate in order to influence the opinions of the listeners. You are simply and clearly defining the debate. If you watch the evening news on a major network television (ABC, CBS, or NBC), you will see newscasters who undoubtedly have personal opinions about the news, but are trained to avoid expressing those opinions through the use of loaded words, gestures, facial expressions, or vocal tone. Like those newscasters, you are already educating your listeners simply by informing them. Let them make up their own minds. This is probably the most important reason for informative speaking.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Making Information Clear and Interesting for the Audience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_p01">A clear and interesting speech can make use of description, causal analysis, or categories. With description, you use words to create a picture in the minds of your audience. You can describe physical realities, social realities, emotional experiences, sequences, consequences, or contexts. For instance, you can describe the mindset of the Massachusetts town of Salem during the witch trials. You can also use causal analysis, which focuses on the connections between causes and consequences. For example, in speaking about health care costs, you could explain how a serious illness can put even a well-insured family into bankruptcy. You can also use categories to group things together. For instance, you could say that there are three categories of investment for the future: liquid savings, avoiding debt, and acquiring properties that will increase in value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_p02">There are a number of principles to keep in mind as a speaker to make the information you present clear and interesting for your audience. Let’s examine several of them.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Adjust Complexity to the Audience</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s01_p01">If your speech is too complex or too simplistic, it will not hold the interest of your listeners. How can you determine the right level of complexity? Your audience analysis is one important way to do this. Will your listeners belong to a given age group, or are they more diverse? Did they all go to public schools in the United States, or are some of your listeners international students? Are they all students majoring in communication studies, or is there a mixture of majors in your audience? The answers to these and other audience analysis questions will help you to gauge what they know and what they are curious about.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s01_p02">Never assume that just because your audience is made up of students, they all share your knowledge set. If you base your speech on an assumption of similar knowledge, you might not make sense to everyone. If, for instance, you’re an intercultural communication student discussing <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">multiple identities</a><span class="glossdef">In communication studies, the idea that everyone has identities connected to family, religion, occupation, cultural origin, gender, and other characteristics.</span></span>, the psychology students in your audience will most likely reject your message. Similarly, the term “viral” has very different meanings depending on whether it is used with respect to human disease, popular response to a website, or population theory. In using the word “viral,” you absolutely must explain specifically what you mean. You should not hurry your explanation of a term that’s vulnerable to misinterpretation. Make certain your listeners know what you mean before continuing your speech. Stephen Lucas explains, “You cannot assume they will know what you mean. Rather, you must be sure to explain everything so thoroughly that they cannot help but understand.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn16_001">Lucas, Stephen E. (2004). <em class="emphasis">The art of public speaking</em>. Boston: McGraw-Hill.</span> Define terms to help listeners understand them the way you mean them to. Give explanations that are consistent with your definitions, and show how those ideas apply to your speech topic. In this way, you can avoid many misunderstandings.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s01_p03">Similarly, be very careful about assuming there is anything that “everybody knows.” Suppose you’ve decided to present an informative speech on the survival of the early colonists of New England. You may have learned in elementary school that their survival was attributable, in part, to the assistance of Squanto. Many of your listeners will know which states are in New England, but if there are international students in the audience, they might never have heard of New England. You should clarify the term either by pointing out the region on a map or by stating that it’s the six states in the American northeast. Other knowledge gaps can still confound the effectiveness of the speech. For instance, who or what was Squanto? What kind of assistance did the settlers get? Only a few listeners are likely to know that Squanto spoke English and that fact had greatly surprised the settlers when they landed. It was through his knowledge of English that Squanto was able to advise these settlers in survival strategies during that first harsh winter. If you neglect to provide that information, your speech will not be fully informative.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s01_p04">Beyond the opportunity to help improve your delivery, one important outcome of practicing your speech in front of a live audience of a couple of friends or classmates is that you can become aware of terms that are confusing or that you should define for your audience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Avoid Unnecessary Jargon</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s02_p01">If you decide to give an informative speech on a highly specialized topic, limit how much technical language or jargon you use. Loading a speech with specialized language has the potential to be taxing on the listeners. It can become too difficult to “translate” your meanings, and if that happens, you will not effectively deliver information. Even if you define many technical terms, the audience may feel as if they are being bombarded with a set of definitions instead of useful information. Don’t treat your speech as a crash course in an entire topic. If you must, introduce one specialized term and carefully define and explain it to the audience. Define it in words, and then use a concrete and relevant example to clarify the meaning.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s02_p02">Some topics, by their very nature, are too technical for a short speech. For example, in a five-minute speech you would be foolish to try to inform your audience about the causes of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear emergency that occurred in Japan in 2011. Other topics, while technical, can be presented in audience-friendly ways that minimize the use of technical terms. For instance, in a speech about Mount Vesuvius, the volcano that buried the ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, you can use the term “pyroclastic flow” as long as you take the time to either show or tell what it means.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Create Concrete Images</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s03_p01">As a college student, you have had a significant amount of exposure to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">abstract</a><span class="glossdef">A term that is imprecise, leaving the meaning open to interpretation.</span></span> terms. You have become comfortable using and hearing a variety of abstract ideas. However, abstract terms lend themselves to many interpretations. For instance, the abstract term “responsibility” can mean many things. Among other meanings, it can mean duty, task, authority, or blame. Because of the potential for misunderstanding, it is better to use a <em class="emphasis">concrete</em> word. For example, instead of saying, “Helen Worth was responsible for the project,” you will convey clearer meaning when you say, “Helen Worth was in charge of the project,” “Helen Kimes made the project a success,” or “Helen Worth was to blame for the failure of the project.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s03_p02">To illustrate the differences between abstract and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">concrete</a><span class="glossdef">A term that directly names a specific thing. Its meaning is unlikely to require any interpretation.</span></span> language, let’s look at a few pairs of terms:</p>
            <div class="informaltable block" frame="all">
                <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th><strong class="emphasis bold">Abstract</strong></th>
                            <th><strong class="emphasis bold">Concrete</strong></th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>transportation</td>
                            <td>air travel</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>success</td>
                            <td>completion of project</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>discrimination</td>
                            <td>exclusion of women</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>athletic</td>
                            <td>physically fit</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>profound</td>
                            <td>knowledgeable</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s03_p03">By using an abstraction in a sentence and then comparing the concrete term in the sentence, you will notice the more precise meanings of the concrete terms. Those precise terms are less likely to be misunderstood. In the last pair of terms, “knowledgeable” is listed as a concrete term, but it can also be considered an abstract term. Still, it’s likely to be much clearer and more precise than “profound.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Keep Information Limited</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s04_p01">When you developed your speech, you carefully narrowed your topic in order to keep information limited yet complete and coherent. If you carefully adhere to your own narrowing, you can keep from going off on tangents or confusing your audience. If you overload your audience with information, they will be unable to follow your narrative. Use the definitions, descriptions, explanations, and examples you need in order to make your meanings clear, but resist the temptation to add <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tangential</a><span class="glossdef">Information that is somewhat related to the topic and thesis but is, nonetheless, a digression.</span></span> information merely because you find it interesting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Link Current Knowledge to New Knowledge</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s05_p01">Certain sets of knowledge are common to many people in your classroom audience. For instance, most of them know what Wikipedia is. Many have found it a useful and convenient source of information about topics related to their coursework. Because many Wikipedia entries are lengthy, greatly annotated, and followed by substantial lists of authoritative sources, many students have relied on information acquired from Wikipedia in writing papers to fulfill course requirements. All this is information that virtually every classroom listener is likely to know. This is the current knowledge of your audience.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s05_p02">Because your listeners are already familiar with Wikipedia, you can link important new knowledge to their already-existing knowledge. Wikipedia is an “open source,” meaning that anyone can supplement, edit, correct, distort, or otherwise alter the information in Wikipedia. In addition to your listeners’ knowledge that a great deal of good information can be found in Wikipedia, they must now know that it isn’t authoritative. Some of your listeners may not enjoy hearing this message, so you must find a way to make it acceptable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s05_p03">One way to make the message acceptable to your listeners is to show what Wikipedia does well. For example, some Wikipedia entries contain many good references at the end. Most of those references are likely to be authoritative, having been written by scholars. In searching for information on a topic, a student can look up one or more of those references in full-text databases or in the library. In this way, Wikipedia can be helpful in steering a student toward the authoritative information they need. Explaining this to your audience will help them accept, rather than reject, the bad news about Wikipedia.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s06">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Make It Memorable</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s06_p01">If you’ve already done the preliminary work in choosing a topic, finding an interesting narrowing of that topic, developing and using presentation aids, and working to maintain audience contact, your delivery is likely to be memorable. Now you can turn to your content and find opportunities to make it appropriately vivid. You can do this by using explanations, comparisons, examples, or language.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s06_p02">Let’s say that you’re preparing a speech on the United States’ internment of Japanese American people from the San Francisco Bay area during World War II. Your goal is to paint a memorable image in your listeners’ minds. You can do this through a dramatic contrast, before and after. You could say, “In 1941, the Bay area had a vibrant and productive community of Japanese American citizens who went to work every day, opening their shops, typing reports in their offices, and teaching in their classrooms, just as they had been doing for years. But on December 7, 1941, everything changed. Within six months, Bay area residents of Japanese ancestry were gone, transported to internment camps located hundreds of miles from the Pacific coast.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s06_p03">This strategy rests on the ability of the audience to visualize the two contrasting situations. You have alluded to two sets of images that are familiar to most college students, images that they can easily visualize. Once the audience imagination is engaged in visualization, they are likely to remember the speech.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s06_p04">Your task of providing memorable imagery does not stop after the introduction. While maintaining an even-handed approach that does not seek to persuade, you must provide the audience with information about the circumstances that triggered the policy of internment, perhaps by describing the advice that was given to President Roosevelt by his top advisers. You might depict the conditions faced by Japanese Americans during their internment by describing a typical day one of the camps. To conclude your speech on a memorable note, you might name a notable individual—an actor, writer, or politician—who is a survivor of the internment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s06_p05">Such a strategy might feel unnatural to you. After all, this is not how you talk to your friends or participate in a classroom discussion. Remember, though, that public speaking is not the same as talking. It’s prepared and formal. It demands more of you. In a conversation, it might not be important to be memorable; your goal might merely be to maintain friendship. But in a speech, when you expect the audience to pay attention, you must make the speech memorable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s07">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Make It Relevant and Useful</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s07_p01">When thinking about your topic, it is always very important to keep your audience members center stage in your mind. For instance, if your speech is about air pollution, ask your audience to imagine feeling the burning of eyes and lungs caused by smog. This is a strategy for making the topic more real to them, since it may have happened to them on a number of occasions; and even if it hasn’t, it easily could. If your speech is about Mark Twain, instead of simply saying that he was very famous during his lifetime, remind your audience that he was so prominent that their own great-grandparents likely knew of his work and had strong opinions about it. In so doing, you’ve connected your topic to their own forebears.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s08">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Personalize Your Content</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s08_p01">Giving a human face to a topic helps the audience perceive it as interesting. If your topic is related to the Maasai rite of passage into manhood, the prevalence of drug addiction in a particular locale, the development of a professional filmmaker, or the treatment of a disease, putting a human face should not be difficult. To do it, find a case study you can describe within the speech, referring to the human subject by name. This conveys to the audience that these processes happen to real people.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s08_p02">Make sure you use a real case study, though—don’t make one up. Using a fictional character without letting your audience know that the example is hypothetical is a betrayal of the listener’s trust, and hence, is unethical.</p>

            <li>Identify several categories of topics that may be used in informative speaking.</li>

        </ol>
    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_p01">For some speakers, deciding on a topic is one of the most difficult parts of informative speaking. The following subsections begin by discussing several categories of topics that you might use for an informative presentation. Then we discuss how you might structure your speech to address potential audience difficulties in understanding your topic or information.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Objects</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s01_p01">The term “objects” encompasses many topics we might not ordinarily consider to be “things.” It’s a category that includes people, institutions, places, substances, and inanimate things. The following are some of these topics:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>Mitochondria</li>
            <li>Dream catchers</li>
            <li>Sharks</li>
            <li>Hubble telescope</li>
            <li>Seattle’s Space Needle</li>
            <li>Malta</li>
            <li>Silicon chip</li>
            <li>Spruce Goose</li>
            <li>Medieval armor</li>
            <li>DDT insecticide</li>
            <li>Soy inks</li>
            <li>NAACP</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s01_p02">You will find it necessary to narrow your topic about an object because, like any topic, you can’t say everything about it in a single speech. In most cases, there are choices about how to narrow the topic. Here are some specific purpose statements that reflect ways of narrowing a few of those topics:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s01_l02">
            <li>To inform the audience about the role of soy inks in reducing toxic pollution</li>
            <li>To inform the audience about the current uses of the banned insecticide DDT</li>
            <li>To inform the audience about what we’ve learned from the Hubble telescope</li>
            <li>To inform the audience about the role of the NAACP in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</li>
            <li>To describe the significance of the gigantic Spruce Goose, the wooden airplane that launched an airline</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s01_p03">These specific purposes reflect a narrow, but interesting, approach to each topic. These purposes are precise, and they should help you maintain your focus on a narrow but deep slice of knowledge.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">People</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s02_p01">This category applies both to specific individuals and also to roles. The following are some of these topics:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Dalai Lamas</li>
            <li>Astronauts</li>
            <li>Tsar Nicholas II</li>
            <li>Modern midwives</li>
            <li>Mata Hari</li>
            <li>Catherine the Great</li>
            <li>Navajo code talkers</li>
            <li>Mahatma Gandhi</li>
            <li>Justice Thurgood Marshall</li>
            <li>Madame Curie</li>
            <li>Leopold Mozart</li>
            <li>Aristotle</li>
            <li>The Hemlock Society</li>
            <li>Sonia Sotomayor</li>
            <li>Jack the Ripper</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s02_p02">There is a great deal of information about each one of these examples. In order to narrow the topic or write a thesis statement, it’s important to recognize that your speech should not be a biography, or time line, of someone’s life. If you attempt to deliver a comprehensive report of every important event and accomplishment related to your subject, then nothing will seem any more important than anything else. To capture and hold your audience’s interest, you must narrow to a focus on a feature, event, achievement, or secret about your human topic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s02_p03">Here are some purpose statements that reflect a process of narrowing:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s02_l02">
            <li>To inform the audience about the training program undergone by the first US astronauts to land on the moon</li>
            <li>To inform the audience about how a young Dalai Lama is identified</li>
            <li>To inform the audience about why Gandhi was regarded as a mahatma, or “great heart”</li>
            <li>To inform the audience about the extensive scientific qualifications of modern midwives</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s02_p04">Without a limited purpose, you will find, with any of these topics, that there’s simply too much to say. Your purpose statement will be a strong decision-making tool about what to include in your speech.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Events</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_p01">An event can be something that occurred only once, or an event that is repeated:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_l01">
            <li>The murder of Emmett Till</li>
            <li>The Iditarod Dogsled Race</li>
            <li>The Industrial Revolution</li>
            <li>The discovery of the smallpox vaccine</li>
            <li>The Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests</li>
            <li>The Bay of Pigs</li>
            <li>The Super Bowl</li>
            <li>The Academy Awards</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_p02">Again, we find that any of these topics must be carefully narrowed in order to build a coherent speech. Failure to do so will result in a shallow speech. Here are a few ways to narrow the purpose:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_l02">
            <li>To explain how the murder of Emmett Till helped energize the civil rights movement</li>
            <li>To describe how the Industrial Revolution affected the lives of ordinary people</li>
            <li>To inform the audience about the purpose of the Iditarod dogsled race</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_p03">There are many ways to approach any of these and other topics, but again, you must emphasize an important dimension of the event. Otherwise, you run the risk of producing a time line in which the main point gets lost. In a speech about an event, you may use a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chronological order</a><span class="glossdef">Time order; the order in which events take place.</span></span>, but if you choose to do so, you can’t include every detail. The following is an example:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_p04"><em class="emphasis">Specific Purpose:</em> To inform the audience about the purpose of the Iditarod dogsled race.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_p05"><em class="emphasis">Central Idea:</em> The annual Iditarod commemorates the heroism of Balto, the sled dog that led a dog team carrying medicine 1150 miles to save Nome from an outbreak of diphtheria.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_p06"><em class="emphasis">Main Points:</em></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_l03" numeration="upperroman">
            <li>Diphtheria broke out in a remote Alaskan town.</li>
            <li>Dogsleds were the only transportation for getting medicine.</li>
            <li>The Iditarod Trail was long, rugged, and under siege of severe weather.</li>
            <li>Balto the dog knew where he was going, even when the musher did not.</li>
            <li>The annual race commemorates Balto’s heroism in saving the lives of the people of Nome.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_p07">In this example, you must explain the event. However, another way to approach the same event would describe it. The following is an example:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_p08"><em class="emphasis">Specific Purpose:</em> To describe the annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_p09"><em class="emphasis">Central Idea:</em> It’s a long and dangerous race.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_p10"><em class="emphasis">Main Points:</em></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_l04" numeration="upperroman">
            <li>The 1150-mile, ten- to seventeen-day race goes through wilderness with widely spaced checkpoints for rest, first aid, and getting fresh dogs.</li>
            <li>A musher, or dogsled driver, must be at least fourteen years old to endure the rigors of severe weather, exhaustion, and loneliness.</li>
            <li>A musher is responsible for his or her own food, food for twelve to sixteen dogs, and for making sure they don’t get lost.</li>
            <li>Reaching the end of the race without getting lost, even in last place, is considered honorable and heroic.</li>
            <li>The expense of participation is greater than the prize awarded to the winner.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_p11">By now you can see that there are various ways to approach a topic while avoiding an uninspiring time line. In the example of the Iditarod race, you could alternatively frame it as an Alaskan tourism topic, or you could emphasize the enormous staff involved in first aid, search and rescue, dog care, trail maintenance, event coordination, financial management, and registration.</p>

    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Concepts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p01">Concepts are abstract ideas that exist independent of whether they are observed or practiced, such as the example of social equality that follows. Concepts can include hypotheses and theories.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_l01">
            <li>The glass ceiling</li>

            <li>Autism</li>
            <li>Karma</li>
            <li>Wellness</li>
            <li>Fairness theory</li>
            <li>Bioethics</li>
            <li>The American Dream</li>
            <li>Social equality</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p02">Here are a few examples of specific purposes developed from the examples:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_l02">
            <li>To explain why people in all cultures are ethnocentric</li>
            <li>To describe the Hindu concept of karma</li>
            <li>To distinguish the differences between the concepts of wellness and health</li>
            <li>To show the resources available in our local school system for children with autism</li>
            <li>To explain three of Dr. Stephen Suranovic’s seven categories of fairness</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p03">Here is one possible example of a way to develop one of these topics:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p04"><em class="emphasis">Specific Purpose:</em> To explain why people in all cultures are ethnocentric.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p05"><em class="emphasis">Central Idea:</em> There are benefits to being ethnocentric.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p06"><em class="emphasis">Main Points:</em></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_l03" numeration="upperroman">
            <li>Ethnocentrism is the idea that one’s own culture is superior to others.</li>
            <li>Ethnocentrism strongly contributes to positive group identity.</li>
            <li>Ethnocentrism facilitates the coordination of social activity.</li>
            <li>Ethnocentrism contributes to a sense of safety within a group.</li>
            <li>Ethnocentrism becomes harmful when it creates barriers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p07">In an example of a concept about which people disagree, you must represent multiple and conflicting views as fully and fairly as possible. For instance:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p08"><em class="emphasis">Specific Purpose:</em> To expose the audience to three different views of the American Dream.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p09"><em class="emphasis">Central Idea:</em> The American Dream is a shared dream, an impossible dream, or a dangerous dream, depending on the perspective of the individual.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p10"><em class="emphasis">Main Points:</em></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_l04" numeration="upperroman">
            <li>The concept of the American Dream describes a state of abundant well-being in which an honest and productive American can own a home; bring up a family; work at a permanent, well-paying job with benefits; and retire in security and leisure.</li>
            <li>Many capitalists support the social pattern of working hard to deserve and acquire the material comforts and security of a comfortable life.</li>
            <li>Many sociologists argue that the American Dream is far out of reach for the 40 percent of Americans at the bottom of the economic scale.</li>
            <li>Many environmentalists argue that the consumption patterns that accompany the American Dream have resulted in the depletion of resources and the pollution of air, water, and soil.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Processes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p01">If your speech topic is a process, your goal should be to help your audience understand it, or be able to perform it. In either instance, processes involve a predictable series of changes, phases, or steps.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_l01">
            <li>Soil erosion</li>
            <li>Cell division</li>
            <li>Physical therapy</li>
            <li>Volcanic eruption</li>
            <li>Paper recycling</li>
            <li>Consumer credit evaluations</li>
            <li>Scholarship money searches</li>
            <li>Navy Seal training</li>
            <li>Portfolio building</li>
            <li>The development of Alzheimer’s disease</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p02">For some topics, you will need presentation aids in order to make your meaning clear to your listeners. Even in cases where you don’t absolutely need a presentation aid, one might be useful. For instance, if your topic is evaluating consumer credit, instead of just describing a comparison between two different interest rates applied to the same original amount of debt, it would be helpful to show a graph of the difference. This might also be the sort of topic that would strongly serve the needs of your audience before they find themselves in trouble. Since this will be an informative speech, you must resist the impulse to tell your listeners that one form of borrowing is good and another is bad; you must simply show them the difference in numbers. They can reach their own conclusions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p03">Organizing your facts is crucially important when discussing a process. Every stage of a process must be clear and understandable. When two or more things occur at the same time, as they might in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, it is important to make it clear that several things are occurring at once. For example, as plaque is accumulating in the brain, the patient is likely to begin exhibiting various symptoms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p04">Here’s an example of the initial steps of a speech about a process:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p05"><em class="emphasis">Specific Purpose:</em> To inform the audience about how to build an academic portfolio.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p06"><em class="emphasis">Central Idea:</em> A portfolio represents you and emphasizes your best skills.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p07"><em class="emphasis">Main Points:</em></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_l02" numeration="upperroman">
            <li>A portfolio is an organized selection containing the best examples of the skills you can offer an employer.</li>
            <li>A portfolio should contain samples of a substantial body of written work, print and electronically published pieces, photography, and DVDs of your media productions.</li>
            <li>A portfolio should be customized for each prospective employer.</li>
            <li>The material in your portfolio should be consistent with the skills and experience in your résumé.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p08">In a speech about the process of building a portfolio, there will be many smaller steps to include within each of the main points. For instance, creating separate sections of the portfolio for different types of creative activities, writing a table of contents, labeling and dating your samples, making your samples look attractive and professional, and other steps should be inserted where it makes the most sense, in the most organized places, in order to give your audience the most coherent understanding possible.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p09">You’ve probably noticed that there are topics that could be appropriate in more than one category. For instance, the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helen’s could be legitimately handled as an event or as a process. If you approach the eruption as an event, most of the information you include will focus on human responses and the consequences on humans and the landscape. If you approach the eruption as a process, you will be using visual aids and explanations to describe geological changes before and during the eruption. You might also approach this topic from the viewpoint of a person whose life was affected by the eruption. This should remind you that there are many ways to approach most topics, and because of that, your narrowing choices and your purpose will be the important foundation determining the structure of your informative speech.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Developing Your Topic for the Audience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_p01">One issue to consider when preparing an informative speech is how best to present the information to enhance audience learning. Katherine Rowan suggests focusing on areas where your audience may experience confusion and using the likely sources of confusion as a guide for developing the content of your speech. Rowan identifies three sources of audience confusion: difficult concepts or language, difficult-to-envision structures or processes, and ideas that are difficult to understand because they are hard to believe.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn16_002">Rowan, K. E. (1995). A new pedagogy for explanatory public speaking: Why arrangement should not substitute for invention. <em class="emphasis">Communication Education, 44</em>, 236–249.</span> The following subsections will discuss each of these and will provide strategies for dealing with each of these sources of confusion.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Difficult Concepts or Language</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_s01_p01">Sometimes audiences may have difficulty understanding information because of the concepts or language used. For example, they may not understand what the term “organic food” means or how it differs from “all-natural” foods. If an audience is likely to experience confusion over a basic concept or term, Rowan suggests using an elucidating explanation composed of four parts. The purpose of such an explanation is to clarify the meaning and use of the concept by focusing on essential features of the concept.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_s01_p02">The first part of an elucidating explanation is to provide a typical exemplar, or example that includes all the central features of the concept. If you are talking about what is fruit, an apple or orange would be a typical exemplar.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_s01_p03">The second step Rowan suggests is to follow up the typical exemplar with a definition. Fruits might be defined as edible plant structures that contain the seeds of the plant.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_s01_p04">After providing a definition, you can move on to the third part of the elucidating explanation: providing a variety of examples and nonexamples. Here is where you might include less typical examples of fruit, such as avocados, squash, or tomatoes, and foods, such as rhubarb, which is often treated as a fruit but is not by definition.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_s01_p05">Fourth, Rowan suggests concluding by having the audience practice distinguishing examples from nonexamples. In this way, the audience leaves the speech with a clear understanding of the concept.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Difficult-to-Envision Processes or Structures</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_s02_p01">A second source of audience difficulty in understanding, according to Rowan, is a process or structure that is complex and difficult to envision. The blood circulation system in the body might be an example of a difficult-to-envision process. To address this type of audience confusion, Rowan suggests a quasi-scientific explanation, which starts by giving a big-picture perspective on the process. Presentation aids or analogies might be helpful in giving an overview of the process. For the circulatory system, you could show a video or diagram of the entire system or make an analogy to a pump. Then you can move to explaining relationships among the components of the process. Be sure when you explain relationships among components that you include transition and linking words like “leads to” and “because” so that your audience understands relationships between concepts. You may remember the childhood song describing the bones in the body with lines such as, “the hip bone’s connected to the thigh bone; the thigh bone’s connected to the knee bone.” Making the connections between components helps the audience to remember and better understand the process.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Difficult to Understand because It’s Hard to Believe</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_s03_p01">A third source of audience confusion, and perhaps the most difficult to address as a speaker, is an idea that’s difficult to understand because it’s hard to believe. This often happens when people have implicit, but erroneous, theories about how the world works. For example, the idea that science tries to disprove theories is difficult for some people to understand; after all, shouldn’t the purpose of science be to prove things? In such a case, Rowan suggests using a transformative explanation. A transformative explanation begins by discussing the audience’s implicit theory and showing why it is plausible. Then you move to showing how the implicit theory is limited and conclude by presenting the accepted explanation and why that explanation is better. In the case of scientists disproving theories, you might start by talking about what science has proven (e.g., the causes of malaria, the usefulness of penicillin in treating infection) and why focusing on science as proof is a plausible way of thinking. Then you might show how the science as proof theory is limited by providing examples of ideas that were accepted as “proven” but were later found to be false, such as the belief that diseases are caused by miasma, or “bad air”; or that bloodletting cures diseases by purging the body of “bad humors.” You can then conclude by showing how science is an enterprise designed to disprove theories and that all theories are accepted as tentative in light of existing knowledge.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_s03_p02">Rowan’s framework is helpful because it keeps our focus on the most important element of an informative speech: increasing audience understanding about a topic.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Ethics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s07_p01">Honesty and credibility must undergird your presentation; otherwise, they betray the trust of your listeners. Therefore, if you choose a topic that turns out to be too difficult, you must decide what will serve the needs and interests of the audience. Shortcuts and oversimplifications are not the answer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s02_s07_p02">Being ethical often involves a surprising amount of work. In the case of choosing too ambitious a topic, you have some choices:</p>
