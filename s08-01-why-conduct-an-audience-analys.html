        <h2 class="title editable block">Acknowledge the Audience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01">Picture yourself in front of the audience, about to deliver your speech. This is the moment when your relationship with your audience begins, and the quality of this relationship will influence how receptive they will be to your ideas, or at least how willing they’ll be to listen to what you have to say. One of the best ways to initiate this relationship is by finding a way to acknowledge your audience. This can be as simple as establishing eye contact and thanking them for coming to hear your presentation. If they’ve braved bad weather, are missing a world-class sports event, or are putting up with an inconvenience such as a stuffy conference room, tell them how much you appreciate their presence in spite of the circumstances. This can go a long way toward getting them “on board” with your message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p02">For a political candidate who is traveling from town to town giving what may be perceived as the same campaign speech time and time again, a statement like “It’s great to be here in Springfield, and I want to thank the West Valley League of Women Voters and our hosts, the Downtown Senior Center, for the opportunity to be with you today” lets the audience know that the candidate has at least taken the trouble to tailor the speech to the present audience. Stephanie Coopman and James Lull tell us that Microsoft chairman Bill Gates often adapts to his audiences by thanking them for their participation in the computer industry or for their preparation to participate in an electronic world. The authors say, “Even those brief acknowledgments let audience members know that Gates had prepared his speech with them in mind.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_002">Coopman, S. J., &amp; Lull, J. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Public speaking: The evolving art</em>. Boston, MA: Wadsworth Cengage.</span> We will cover audience acknowledgment further in <a class="xref" href="wrench_1.0-ch10#wrench_1.0-ch10">Chapter 10 "Creating the Body of a Speech"</a>.</p>

    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Choose a Worthwhile Topic</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p01">Your selection of a topic should reflect your regard for the audience. There is no universal list of good or bad topics, but you have an ethical responsibility to select a topic that will be worth listening to. As a student, you are probably sensitive to how unpleasant it would be to listen to a speech on a highly complex or technical topic that you found impossible to understand. However, have you considered that audiences do not want to waste their time or attention listening to a speech that is too simple? Many students find themselves tempted to choose an easy topic, or a topic they already know a great deal about. This is an understandable temptation; if you are like most students, you have many commitments and the demands on your time are considerable. Many experts encourage students to begin with something they already know. However, our experience tells us that students often do this simply to reduce their workload. For example, if the purpose of your speech is to inform or persuade students in your public speaking class, a topic such as fitness, drunk driving, the Greek system (campus fraternities and sororities), or credit card responsibility may be easy for you to address, but it is unlikely to go very far toward informing your audience, and in all likelihood, it will not be persuading them either. Instead, your audience members and your professor will quickly recognize that you were thinking of your own needs rather than those of your audience.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p02">To avoid this trap, it behooves you to seek a topic that will be novel and interesting both for you and for your audience. It will also be important to do some credible research in order to ensure that even the most informed audience members will learn something from you. There are many topics that could provide a refreshing departure from your usual academic studies. Topics such as the Bermuda Triangle, biopiracy, the environmental niche of sharks, the green lifestyle, and the historic Oneida Community all provide interesting views of human and natural phenomena not usually provided in public education. Such topics might be more likely to hold the interest of your classroom audience than topics they’ve heard about time and time again.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p03">You should be aware that your audience will not have the same set of knowledge that you do. For instance, if you are speaking about biopiracy, you should probably define it and give a clear example. If your speech is on the green lifestyle, it would be important to frame it as a realistic choice, not a goal so remote as to be hopeless. In each case, you should use audience analysis to consider how your audience will respond to you, your topic, and your message.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Clarity</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p01">Nothing is more lamentable than a rhetorical actor who endeavors to make grandiose the impressions of others through the utilization of an elephantine albeit nonsensical <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">argot</a><span class="glossdef">Specialized vocabulary or jargon of a particular profession or social group.</span></span>—or nothing is worse than a speaker who tries to impress the audience with a giant vocabulary that no one understands. In the first portion of the preceding sentence, we pulled out as many polysyllabic words as we could find. Unfortunately, most people will just find the sentence wordy and the meaning will pass right over their heads. As such, we as public speakers must ensure that we are clear in what we say.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p02">Make sure that you state your topic clearly at the outset, using words that your audience will understand. Letting them know what to expect from your speech shows consideration for them as listeners and lets them know that you value their time and attention.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p03">Throughout your speech, define your terms clearly and carefully in order to avoid misleading or alarming people by mistake. Be careful not to use jargon or “insider” language that will exclude listeners who aren’t “in the know.” If you approach audience analysis in haste, you might find yourself presenting a speech with no clear message. You might avoid making any statements outright from fear of offending. It is much better to know to whom you’re speaking and to present a clear, decisive message that lets listeners know what you think.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Controversial Topics Are Important and Risky</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p01">Some of the most interesting topics are controversial. They are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">controversial topics</a><span class="glossdef">Topics surrounded by diverse and deeply felt feelings and opinions.</span></span> because people have deeply felt values and beliefs on different sides of those topics. For instance, before you choose nuclear energy as your topic, investigate the many voices speaking out both in favor and against increasing its use. Many people perceive nuclear energy as a clean, reliable, and much-needed source of energy. Others say that even the mining of uranium is harmful to the environment, that we lack satisfactory solutions for storing nuclear waste, and that nuclear power plants are vulnerable to errors and attacks. Another group might view the issue economically, believing that industry needs nuclear energy. Engineers might believe that if the national grid could be modernized, we would have enough energy, and that we should strive to use and waste less energy until modernization is feasible. Some might feel deep concern about our reliance on foreign oil. Others might view nuclear energy as more tried-and-true than other alternatives. The topic is extremely controversial, and yet it is interesting and very important.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p02">You shouldn’t avoid controversy altogether, but you should choose your topic carefully. Moreover, how you treat your audience is just as important as how you treat your topic. If your audience has widely diverse views, take the time to acknowledge the concerns they have. Treat them as intelligent people, even if you don’t trust the completeness or the accuracy of their beliefs about your topic.</p>

    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Adapt Your Speech to Audience Needs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p01">When preparing a speech for a classroom audience consisting of other students and your professor, you may feel that you know their interests and expectations fairly well. However, we learn public speaking in order to be able to address other audiences where we can do some good. In some cases, your audience might consist of young children who are not ready to accept the fact that a whale is not a fish or that the moon is always round even though it sometimes appears to be a crescent or a half circle. In other cases, your audience might include retirees living on fixed incomes and who therefore might not agree that raising local taxes is a vital “investment in the future.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p02">Even in an audience that appears to be <em class="emphasis">homogeneous</em>—composed of people who are very similar to one another—different listeners will understand the same ideas in different ways. Every member of every audience has his or her own <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">frame of reference</a><span class="glossdef">An individual’s unique set of perspectives, experience, knowledge, and values.</span></span>—the unique set of perspectives, experience, knowledge, and values belonging to every individual. An audience member who has been in a car accident caused by a drunk driver might not appreciate a lighthearted joke about barhopping. Similarly, stressing the importance of graduate school might be discouraging to audience members who don’t know whether they can even afford to stay in college to complete an undergraduate degree.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p03">These examples illustrate why audience analysis—the process of learning all you reasonably can about your audience—is so centrally important. Audience analysis includes consideration of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">demographic information</a><span class="glossdef">Information about the audience’s gender, age range, marital status, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other variables that can influence their frame of reference.</span></span>, such as the gender, age range, marital status, race, and ethnicity of the people in your audience. Another, perhaps less obvious, demographic factor is <em class="emphasis">socioeconomic status</em>, which refers to a combination of characteristics including income, wealth, level of education, and occupational prestige. Each of these dimensions gives you some information about which kinds of topics, and which aspects of various topics, will be well received.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p04">Suppose you are preparing to give an informative speech about early childhood health care. If your audience is a group of couples who have each recently had a new baby and who live in an affluent suburb, you can expect that they will be young adults with high socioeconomic status; they will likely be eager to know about the very best available health care for their children, whether they are healthy or have various medical problems. In contrast, if your audience is a group of nurses, they may differ in age, but will be similar in education and occupational prestige. They will already know quite a lot about the topic, so you will want to find an aspect that may be new for them, such as community health care resources for families with limited financial resources or for referring children with special needs. As another example, if you are addressing a city council committee that is considering whether to fund a children’s health care initiative, your audience is likely to have very mixed demographics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p05">Audience analysis also takes into account what market researchers call <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">psychographic information</a><span class="glossdef">The audience’s set of beliefs, values, religions, and life experiences.</span></span>, which is more personal and more difficult to predict than demographics. Psychographic information involves the beliefs, attitudes, and values that your audience members embrace. Respecting your audience means that you avoid offending, excluding, or trivializing the beliefs and values they hold. Returning to the topic of early childhood health care, you can expect new parents to be passionate about wanting the best for their child. The psychographics of a group of nurses would revolve around their professional competence and the need to provide “standard of care” for their patients. In a city council committee meeting, the topic of early childhood health care may be a highly personal and emotional issue for some of your listeners, while for others it may be strictly a matter of dollars and cents.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Consider Audience Diversity</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p01">Diversity is a key dimension of audience membership and, therefore, of audience analysis. While the term “diversity” is often used to refer to racial and ethnic minorities, it is important to realize that audiences can be diverse in many other ways as well. Being mindful of diversity means being respectful of all people and striving to avoid <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">racism</a><span class="glossdef">The assumption that one race is superior to another.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethnocentrism</a><span class="glossdef">The belief that one’s own culture is the standard to which other cultures should aspire.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sexism</a><span class="glossdef">The assumption that one sex is weaker, less intelligent, less competent, or less deserving than the other.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ageism</a><span class="glossdef">The attitude of valuing youth and devaluing age.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">elitism</a><span class="glossdef">The practice of thinking the best of those with the highest status and prestige and treating them preferentially.</span></span>, and other assumptions. An interesting “ism” that is not often mentioned is <em class="emphasis">chronocentrism</em>, or the assumption that people today are superior to people who lived in earlier eras.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_003">Russell, J. (1991). Inventing the flat earth. <em class="emphasis">History Today</em>, <em class="emphasis">41</em>(8), 13–19.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p02">Sociologists John R. Logan and Wenquan Zhang analyzed racial and ethnic diversity in US cities and observed a pattern that rewrites the traditional “rules” of neighborhood change.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_004">Logan, J. R., and Zhang, C. (2010). Global neighborhoods: New pathways to diversity and separation. <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Sociology</em>, <em class="emphasis">115</em>, 1069–1109.</span> Whereas in our grandparents’ day a racially mixed neighborhood was one with African American and white residents, in recent decades, many more people from a variety of Asian and Latin American countries have immigrated to the United States. As a result, many cities have neighborhoods that are richly diverse with Asian, Hispanic, and African American cultural influences as well as those of white European Americans. Each cultural group consists of people from many communities and occupations. Each cultural group came to the United States for different reasons and came from different communities and occupations within their original cultures. Even though it can be easy to assume that people from a culture are exactly like each other, we undermine our credibility when we create our message as though members of these cultures are carbon copies of each other.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p03">One of the author’s classes included two students from China. During a discussion of cultural similarity and difference, one remarked, “I thought we would have the same tastes in food because we are both from China, but she likes different spices and cooking techniques than I do.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p04">While race, ethnicity, and culture may be relatively visible aspects of diversity, there are many other aspects that are less obvious, so your audience is often more diverse than you might initially think. Suppose you are going to give a talk on pool safety to residents of a very affluent suburban community—will all your audience members be wealthy? No. There might be some who are unemployed, some who are behind on their mortgage payments, some who live in rented rooms, not to mention some who work as babysitters or housekeepers. Furthermore, if your listeners have some characteristic in common, it doesn’t mean that they all think alike. For instance, if your audience consists of people who are members of military families, don’t assume that they all have identical beliefs about national security. If there are many business students in your audience, don’t assume they all agree about the relative importance of ethics and profits. Instead, recognize that a range of opinion exists.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p05">This is where the <em class="emphasis">frame of reference</em> we mentioned earlier becomes an important concept. People have a wide variety of reasons for making the choices they make and for doing the things they do. For instance, a business student, while knowing that profitability is important, might have a strong interest in green lifestyles, low energy use, and alternative energy sources, areas of economic development that might require a great deal of investment before profits are realized. In fact, some business students may want to be involved in a paradigm shift away from “business as usual.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p06">These examples illustrate how important it is to use audience analysis to avoid <em class="emphasis">stereotyping</em>—taking for granted that people with a certain characteristic in common have the same likes, dislikes, values, and beliefs. All members of our audiences deserve to have the same sensitivity and the same respect extended to them as unique individuals. Respecting diversity is not merely a responsibility within public speaking; it should be a responsibility we strive to embrace in all our human interactions.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Avoid Offending Your Audience</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p01">It might seem obvious that speakers should use audience analysis to avoid making offensive remarks, but even very experienced speakers sometimes forget this basic rule. If you were an Anglo-American elected official addressing a Latino audience, would you make a joke about a Mexican American person’s name sounding similar to the name of a popular brand of tequila? In fact, a state governor did just that in June 2011. Not suprisingly, news organizations covering the event reported that the joke fell flat.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_005">Shahid, A. (2011, June 24). Rick Perry’s Jose Cuervo joke at Latino convention bombs in Texas, as governor mulls 2012 GOP bid. <em class="emphasis">New York Daily News</em>.

We didn’t choose our race, ethnicity, sex, age, sexual orientation, intellectual potential, or appearance. We already know that jokes aimed at people because of their membership in these groups are not just politically incorrect but also ethically wrong.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p02">It is not only insensitive humor that can offend an audience. Speakers also need to be aware of language and nonverbal behaviors that state or imply a negative message about people based on their various membership groups. Examples include language that suggests that all scientists are men, that all relationships are heterosexual, or that all ethnic minorities are unpatriotic. By the same token, we should avoid embedding assumptions about people in our messages. Even the most subtle suggestion may not go unnoticed. For example, if, in your speech, you assume that elderly people are frail and expensively medicated, you may offend people whose elder loved ones do not conform in any way to your assumptions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p03">Scholars Samovar and McDaniel tell us that ethical language choices require four guidelines:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>Be accurate; present the facts accurately.</li>
                <li>Be aware of the emotional impact; make sure that you don’t manipulate feelings.</li>
                <li>Avoid hateful words; refrain from language that disparages or belittles people.</li>
                <li>Be sensitive to the audience; know how audience members prefer to be identified (e.g., Native American instead of Indian, women instead of girls, African American instead of black, disabled instead of crippled).<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_006">Samovar, L. A., &amp; McDaniel, E. R. (2007). <em class="emphasis">Public speaking in a multicultural society</em>. Los Angeles, CA: Roxbury.</span>
</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p04">If you alienate your audience, they will stop listening. They will refuse to accept your message, no matter how true or important it is. They might even become hostile. If you fail to recognize the complexity of your audience members and if you treat them as stereotypes, they will resent your assumptions and doubt your credibility.</p>

Your ethos, or credibility, must be established as you build rapport with your listeners. Have you put forth the effort to learn who they are and what you can offer to them in your speech? Do you respect them as individual human beings? Do you respect them enough to serve their needs and interests? Is your topic relevant and appropriate for them? Is your approach honest and sensitive to their preexisting beliefs? Your ability to answer these questions in a constructive way must be based on the best demographic and psychographic information you can use to learn about your listeners.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_p02">The audience needs to know they can trust the speaker’s motivations, intentions, and knowledge.

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_p03">In order to convey regard and respect for the audience, you must be sincere. You must examine the motives behind your topic choice, the true purpose of your speech, and your willingness to do the work of making sure the content of the speech is true and represents reality. This can be difficult for students who face time constraints and multiple demands on their efforts. However, the attitude you assume for this task represents, in part, the kind of professional, citizen, parent, and human being you want to be. Even if you’ve given this issue little thought up to now, you can examine your motives and the integrity of your research and message construction. Ethically, you should.</p>
