        <p class="para" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s04_p01">Jonathan knows he hasn’t really prepared for his speech very well. Instead of going to the library, he went to a party over the weekend. Instead of finding supporting evidence, he went to the movies with his best friend.</p>
        <p class="para" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s04_p02">Two days before he’s going to give his speech, Jonathan decides that he won’t even bother with the library. Instead, he opts to just write out a quick speech and fill it with lots of “flowery” language. He creates a number of interesting similes and metaphors. He makes sure that his speech has a fun rhythm to it and has some great instances of alliteration.</p>
        <p class="para" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s04_p03">Upon finishing his preparation, Jonathan thinks to himself, <em class="emphasis">Well, the speech may have no content, but no one will really notice</em>.</p>
