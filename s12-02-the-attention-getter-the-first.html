<span class="title-prefix">9.2</span> The Attention-Getter: The First Step of an Introduction</h2>
    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_l01">
            <li>Understand the different tools speakers can use to gain their audience’s attention.</li>
            <li>Name some common mistakes speakers make in trying to gain attention.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_p01">As you know by now, a good introduction will capture an audience’s attention, while a bad introduction can turn an audience against a speaker. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">attention-getter</a><span class="glossdef">The device a speaker uses at the beginning of a speech to capture an audience’s interest and make them interested in the speech’s topic.</span></span> is the device a speaker uses at the beginning of a speech to capture an audience’s interest and make them interested in the speech’s topic. Typically, there are four things to consider in choosing a specific attention-getting device:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_l02">
        <li>Appropriateness or relevance to audience</li>
        <li>Purpose of speech</li>
        <li>Topic</li>
        <li>Occasion</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_p02">First, when selecting an attention-getting device, you want to make sure that the option you choose is actually appropriate and relevant to your specific audience. Different audiences will have different backgrounds and knowledge, so you should use your audience analysis to determine whether specific information you plan on using would be appropriate for a specific audience. For example, if you’re giving a speech on family units to a group of individuals over the age of sixty-five, starting your speech with a reference to the television show <em class="emphasis">Gossip Girl</em> may not be the best idea because the television show may not be relevant to that audience.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_p03">Second, you need to consider the basic purpose of your speech. As discussed earlier in this text, there are three basic purposes you can have for giving a speech: to inform, to persuade, and to entertain. When selecting an attention-getter, you want to make sure that you select one that corresponds with your basic purpose. If your goal is to entertain an audience, then starting a speech with a quotation about how many people are dying in Africa each day from malnutrition may not be the best way to get your audience’s attention. Remember, one of the basic goals of an introduction is to prepare your audience for your speech. If your attention-getter differs drastically in tone from the rest of your speech (e.g., dying in Africa when you want your audience to laugh), the disjointedness may cause your audience to become confused or tune you out completely.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_p04">Your third basic consideration when picking an attention-getting device is your speech topic. Ideally, your attention-getting device should have a relevant connection to your speech. Imagine if a speaker pulled condoms out of his pocket, yelled “Free sex!” and threw the condoms at the audience in the beginning of a speech about the economy. While this may clearly get the audience’s attention, this isn’t really a good way to prepare an audience for a speech about bull and bear markets. Not every attention-getter is appropriate for a given topic. Instead, a speaker could start this speech by explaining that “according to a 2004 episode of 60 Minutes, adults in the United States spend approximately $10 billion annually on adult entertainment, which is roughly the equivalent to the amounts they spend attending professional sporting events, buying music, or going out to the movies.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn09_004">Leung, R. (2004, September 5). Porn in the U.S.A.: Steve Kroft reports on a $10 billion industry. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsnews.com">http://www.cbsnews.com</a></span> Notice how effective the shocking statistic is in clearly introducing the monetary value of the adult entertainment industry.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_p05">The last consideration when picking an attention-getting device involves the speech occasion. Different occasions will necessitate different tones, or particular styles or manners of speaking. For example, a persuasive speech about death and dying shouldn’t be happy and hilarious. An informative speech on the benefits of laughing shouldn’t be dull, dreary, and depressing. When selecting an attention-getter, you want to make sure that the attention-getter sets the tone for the speech.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_p06">Now that we’ve explored the four major considerations you must think of when selecting an attention-getter, let’s look at a range of different attention-getters you may employ. Miller (1946)<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn09_005">Miller, E. (1946). Speech introductions and conclusions. <em class="emphasis">Quarterly Journal of Speech, 32</em>, 181–183.</span> discovered that speakers tend to use one of eleven attention-getting devices when starting a speech. The rest of this section is going to examine these eleven attention-getting devices.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Reference to Subject</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p01">The first attention-getting method to consider is to tell your audience the subject of your speech. This device is probably the most direct, but it may also be the least interesting of the possible attention-getters. Here’s an example:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p02">We are surrounded by statistical information in today’s world, so understanding statistics is becoming paramount to citizenship in the twenty-first century.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p03">This sentence explicitly tells an audience that the speech they are about to hear is about the importance of understanding statistics. While this isn’t the most entertaining or interesting attention-getter, it is very clear and direct.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Reference to Audience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p01">The second attention-getting device to consider is a direct reference to the audience. In this case, the speaker has a clear understanding of the audience and points out that there is something unique about the audience that should make them interested in the speech’s content. Here’s an example:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p02">As human resource professionals, you and I know the importance of talent management. In today’s competitive world, we need to invest in getting and keeping the best talent for our organizations to succeed.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p03">In this example, the speaker reminds the audience of their shared status as human resource professionals and uses the common ground to acknowledge the importance of talent management in human resources.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Quotation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s03_p01">Another way to capture your listeners’ attention is to use the words of another person that relate directly to your topic. Maybe you’ve found a really great quotation in one of the articles or books you read while researching your speech. If not, you can also use a number of sources that compile useful quotations from noted individuals. Probably the most famous quotation book of all time is <em class="emphasis">Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations</em> (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bartleby.com/100">http://www.bartleby.com/100</a>), now in its seventeenth edition. Here are some other websites that contain useful databases of quotations for almost any topic:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s03_l01">
            <li><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quotationspage.com">http://www.quotationspage.com</a></li>
            <li><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bartleby.com/quotations">http://www.bartleby.com/quotations</a></li>
            <li><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quotationreference.com">http://www.quotationreference.com</a></li>
            <li><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.moviequotes.com">http://www.moviequotes.com</a></li>
            <li><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quotesandsayings.com">http://www.quotesandsayings.com</a></li>
            <li><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quoteland.com">http://www.quoteland.com</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s03_p02">Quotations are a great way to start a speech, so let’s look at an example that could be used for a speech on deception:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s03_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s03_p03">Oliver Goldsmith, a sixteenth-century writer, poet, and physician, once noted that “the true use of speech is not so much to express our wants as to conceal them.”</p>
        </span>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Reference to Current Events</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s04_p01">Referring to a current news event that relates to your topic is often an effective way to capture attention, as it immediately makes the audience aware of how relevant the topic is in today’s world. For example, consider this attention-getter for a persuasive speech on frivolous lawsuits:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s04_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s04_p02">On January 10, 2007, Scott Anthony Gomez Jr. and a fellow inmate escaped from a Pueblo, Colorado, jail. During their escape the duo attempted to rappel from the roof of the jail using a makeshift ladder of bed sheets. During Gomez’s attempt to scale the building, he slipped, fell forty feet, and injured his back. After being quickly apprehended, Gomez filed a lawsuit against the jail for making it too easy for him to escape.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s04_p03">In this case, the speaker is highlighting a news event that illustrates what a frivolous lawsuit is, setting up the speech topic of a need for change in how such lawsuits are handled.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Historical Reference</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s05_p01">You may also capture your listeners’ attention by referring to a historical event related to your topic. Obviously, this strategy is closely related to the previous one, except that instead of a recent news event you are reaching further back in history to find a relevant reference. For example, if you are giving a speech on the Iraq War that began in 2003, you could refer back to the Vietnam War as way of making a comparison:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s05_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s05_p02">During the 1960s and ’70s, the United States intervened in the civil strife between North and South Vietnam. The result was a long-running war of attrition in which many American lives were lost and the country of Vietnam suffered tremendous damage and destruction. Today, we see a similar war being waged in Iraq. American lives are being lost, and stability has not yet returned to the region.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s05_p03">In this example, the speaker is evoking the audience’s memories of the Vietnam War to raise awareness of similarities to the war in Iraq.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Anecdote</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s06_p01">Another device you can use to start a speech is to tell an anecdote related to the speech’s topic. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">anecdote</a><span class="glossdef">A brief account or story of an interesting or humorous event.</span></span> is a brief account or story of an interesting or humorous event. Notice the emphasis here is on the word “brief.” A common mistake speakers make when telling an anecdote is to make the anecdote too long. Remember, your entire introduction should only be 10 to 15 percent of your speech, so your attention-getter must be very short.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s06_p02">One type of anecdote is a real story that emphasizes a speech’s basic message. For example, here is an anecdote a speaker could use to begin a speech on how disconnected people are from the real world because of technology:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s06_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s06_p03">In July 2009, a high school girl named Alexa Longueira was walking along a main boulevard near her home on Staten Island, New York, typing in a message on her cell phone. Not paying attention to the world around her, she took a step and fell right into an open manhole.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn09_006">Whitney, L. (2009, July 13). Don’t text while walking? Girl learns the hard way. <em class="emphasis">CNET News Wireless</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10285466-94.html">http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10285466-94.html</a></span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s06_p04">A second type of anecdote is a parable or fable. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">parable or fable</a><span class="glossdef">An allegorical anecdote designed to teach general life lessons.</span></span> is an allegorical anecdote designed to teach general life lessons. The most widely known parables for most Americans are those given in the Bible and the best-known fables are Aesop’s Fables (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aesopfables.com">http://www.aesopfables.com</a>). For the same speech on how disconnected people are with the real world because of technology, the speaker could have used the Fable of The Boy and the Filberts:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s06_bl02">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s06_p05">The ancient Greek writer Aesop told a fable about a boy who put his hand into a pitcher of filberts. The boy grabbed as many of the delicious nuts as he possibly could. But when he tried to pull them out, his hand wouldn’t fit through the neck of the pitcher because he was grasping so many filberts. Instead of dropping some of them so that his hand would fit, he burst into tears and cried about his predicament. The moral of the story? “Don’t try to do too much at once.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn09_007">Aesop (1881). <em class="emphasis">Aesop’s fables</em>. New York, NY: Wm. L. Allison. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.litscape.com/author/Aesop/The_Boy_and_the_Filberts.html">http://www.litscape.com/author/Aesop/The_Boy_and_the_Filberts.html</a></span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s06_p06">After recounting this anecdote, the speaker could easily relate the fable to the notion that the technology in our society leads us to try to do too many things at once.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s06_p07">While parables and fables are short and entertaining, their application to your speech topic should be clear. We’ll talk about this idea in more detail later in this chapter when we discuss how to link your attention-getter explicitly to your topic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s07">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Startling Statement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s07_p01">The eighth device you can use to start a speech is to surprise your audience with startling information about your topic. Often, startling statements come in the form of statistics and strange facts. The goal of a good startling statistic is that it surprises the audience and gets them engaged in your topic. For example, if you’re giving a speech about oil conservation, you could start by saying, “A Boeing 747 airliner holds 57,285 gallons of fuel.” You could start a speech on the psychology of dreams by noting, “The average person has over 1,460 dreams a year.” A strange fact, on the other hand, is a statement that does not involve numbers but is equally surprising to most audiences. For example, you could start a speech on the gambling industry by saying, “There are no clocks in any casinos in Las Vegas.” You could start a speech on the Harlem Globetrotters by saying, “In 2000, Pope John Paul II became the most famous honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters.” All four of these examples came from a great website for strange facts (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.strangefacts.com">http://www.strangefacts.com</a>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s07_p02">Although startling statements are fun, it is important to use them ethically. First, make sure that your startling statement is factual. The Internet is full of startling statements and claims that are simply not factual, so when you find a statement you’d like to use, you have an ethical duty to ascertain its truth before you use it. Second, make sure that your startling statement is relevant to your speech and not just thrown in for shock value. We’ve all heard startling claims made in the media that are clearly made for purposes of shock or fear mongering. As speakers, we have an ethical obligation to avoid playing on people’s emotions in this way.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s08">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Question</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s08_p01">Another strategy for getting your audience’s attention is to ask them a question. There are two types of questions commonly used as attention-getters: response questions and rhetorical questions. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">response question</a><span class="glossdef">A question that the audience is expected to answer in some manner.</span></span> is a question that the audience is expected to answer in some manner. For example, you could ask your audience, “Please raise your hand if you have ever thought about backpacking in Europe” or “Have you ever voted for the Electoral College? If so, stand up.” In both of these cases, the speaker wants her or his audience to respond. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rhetorical question</a><span class="glossdef">A question for which no actual response is expected.</span></span>, on the other hand, is a question to which no actual reply is expected. For example, a speaker talking about the importance of HIV testing could start by asking the audience, “I have two questions that I’d like you to think about. How many students on this campus have had sexual intercourse? Of those who have had sex, how many have been tested for HIV?” In this case, the speaker does not expect the audience to give an estimate of the numbers of students that fit into each category but rather to think about the questions as the speech goes on.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s09">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Humor</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s09_p01">Humor is another effective method for gaining an audience’s attention. Humor is an amazing tool when used properly. We cannot begin to explain all the amazing facets of humor within this text, but we can say that humor is a great way of focusing an audience on what you are saying. However, humor is a double-edged sword. If you do not wield the sword carefully, you can turn your audience against you very quickly. When using humor, you really need to know your audience and understand what they will find humorous. One of the biggest mistakes a speaker can make is to use some form of humor that the audience either doesn’t find funny or finds offensive. Think about how incompetent the character of Michael Scott seems on the television program <em class="emphasis">The Office</em>, in large part because of his ineffective use of humor. We always recommend that you test out humor of any kind on a sample of potential audience members prior to actually using it during a speech.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s09_p02">Now that we’ve warned you about the perils of using humor, let’s talk about how to use humor as an attention-getter. Humor can be incorporated into several of the attention-getting devices mentioned. You could use a humorous anecdote, quotation, or current event. As with other attention-getting devices, you need to make sure your humor is relevant to your topic, as one of the biggest mistakes some novices make when using humor is to add humor that really doesn’t support the overall goal of the speech. So when looking for humorous attention-getters you want to make sure that the humor is nonoffensive to your audiences and relevant to your speech. For example, here’s a humorous quotation from Nicolas Chamfort, a French author during the sixteenth century, “The only thing that stops God from sending another flood is that the first one was useless.” While this quotation could be great for some audiences, other audiences may find this humorous quotation offensive (e.g., religious audiences). The Chamfort quotation could be great for a speech on the ills of modern society, but probably not for a speech on the state of modern religious conflict. You want to make sure that the leap from your attention-getter to your topic isn’t too complicated for your audience, or the attention-getter will backfire.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s10">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Personal Reference</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s10_p01">The tenth device you may consider to start a speech is to refer to a story about yourself that is relevant for your topic. Some of the best speeches are ones that come from personal knowledge and experience. If you are an expert or have firsthand experience related to your topic, sharing this information with the audience is a great way to show that you are credible during your attention-getter. For example, if you had a gastric bypass surgery and you wanted to give an informative speech about the procedure, you could introduce your speech in this way:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s10_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s10_p02">In the fall of 2008, I decided that it was time that I took my life into my own hands. After suffering for years with the disease of obesity, I decided to take a leap of faith and get a gastric bypass in an attempt to finally beat the disease.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s10_p03">If you use a personal example, don’t get carried away with the focus on yourself and your own life. Your speech topic is the purpose of the attention-getter, not the other way around. Another pitfall in using a personal example is that it may be too personal for you to maintain your composure. For example, a student once started a speech about her grandmother by stating, “My grandmother died of cancer at 3:30 this morning.” The student then proceeded to cry nonstop for ten minutes. While this is an extreme example, we strongly recommend that you avoid any material that could get you overly choked up while speaking. When speakers have an emotional breakdown during their speech, audience members stop listening to the message and become very uncomfortable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s11">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Reference to Occasion</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s02_s11_p01">The last device we mention for starting a speech is to refer directly to the speaking occasion. This attention-getter is only useful if the speech is being delivered for a specific occasion. Many toasts, for example, start with the following statement: “Today we are here to honor X.” In this case, the “X” could be a retirement, a marriage, a graduation, or any number of other special occasions. Because of its specific nature, this attention-getter is the least likely to be used for speeches being delivered for college courses.</p>
