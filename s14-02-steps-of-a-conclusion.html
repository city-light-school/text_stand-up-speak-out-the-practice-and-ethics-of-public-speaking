    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_p01">In <a class="xref" href="wrench_1.0-ch11_s01#wrench_1.0-ch11_s01">Section 11.1 "Why Conclusions Matter"</a>, we discussed the importance a conclusion has on a speech. In this section, we’re going to examine the three steps in building an effective conclusion.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Restatement of the Thesis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_p01">Restating a thesis statement is the first step in a powerful conclusion. As we explained in <a class="xref" href="wrench_1.0-ch09#wrench_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Introductions Matter: How to Begin a Speech Effectively"</a>, a thesis statement is a short, declarative sentence that states the purpose, intent, or main idea of a speech. When we restate the thesis statement at the conclusion of our speech, we’re attempting to reemphasize what the overarching main idea of the speech has been. Suppose your thesis statement was, “I will analyze Barack Obama’s use of lyricism in his July 2008 speech, ‘A World That Stands as One.’” You could restate the thesis in this fashion at the conclusion of your speech: “In the past few minutes, I have analyzed Barack Obama’s use of lyricism in his July 2008 speech, ‘A World That Stands as One.’” Notice the shift in tense: the statement has gone from the future tense (this is what I will speak about) to the past tense (this is what I have spoken about). Restating the thesis in your conclusion reminds the audience of the major purpose or goal of your speech, helping them remember it better.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Review of Main Points</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_p01">After restating the speech’s thesis, the second step in a powerful conclusion is to review the main points from your speech. One of the biggest differences between written and oral communication is the necessity of repetition in oral communication. When we preview our main points in the introduction, effectively discuss and make transitions to our main points during the body of the speech, and finally, review the main points in the conclusion, we increase the likelihood that the audience will retain our main points after the speech is over.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_p02">In the introduction of a speech, we deliver a <em class="emphasis">preview</em> of our main body points, and in the conclusion we deliver a <em class="emphasis">review</em>. Let’s look at a sample preview:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_p03">In order to understand the field of gender and communication, I will first differentiate between the terms biological sex and gender. I will then explain the history of gender research in communication. Lastly, I will examine a series of important findings related to gender and communication.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_p04">In this preview, we have three clear main points. Let’s see how we can review them at the conclusion of our speech:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_bl02">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_p05">Today, we have differentiated between the terms biological sex and gender, examined the history of gender research in communication, and analyzed a series of research findings on the topic.</p>
        </span>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_bl03">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_p06">In the past few minutes, I have explained the difference between the terms “biological sex” and “gender,” discussed the rise of gender research in the field of communication, and examined a series of groundbreaking studies in the field.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_p07">Notice that both of these conclusions review the main points originally set forth. Both variations are equally effective reviews of the main points, but you might like the linguistic turn of one over the other. Remember, while there is a lot of science to help us understand public speaking, there’s also a lot of art as well, so you are always encouraged to choose the wording that you think will be most effective for your audience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Concluding Device</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_p01">The final part of a powerful conclusion is the concluding device. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">concluding device</a><span class="glossdef">The device a speaker uses at the end of a speech to ensure that the audience is left with a mental picture predetermined by the speaker.</span></span> is essentially the final thought you want your audience members to have when you stop speaking. It also provides a definitive sense of closure to your speech. One of the authors of this text often makes an analogy between a gymnastics dismount and the concluding device in a speech. Just as a gymnast dismounting the parallel bars or balance beam wants to stick the landing and avoid taking two or three steps, a speaker wants to “stick” the ending of the presentation by ending with a concluding device instead of with, “Well, umm, I guess I’m done.” Miller observed that speakers tend to use one of ten concluding devices when ending a speech.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn11_003">Miller, E. (1946). Speech introductions and conclusions. <em class="emphasis">Quarterly Journal of Speech, 32</em>, 181–183.</span> The rest of this section is going to examine these ten concluding devices.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Conclude with a Challenge</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s01_p01">The first way that Miller found that some speakers end their speeches is with a challenge. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">challenge</a><span class="glossdef">Call to engage in some kind of activity that requires a contest or special effort.</span></span> is a call to engage in some kind of activity that requires a contest or special effort. In a speech on the necessity of fund-raising, a speaker could conclude by challenging the audience to raise 10 percent more than their original projections. In a speech on eating more vegetables, you could challenge your audience to increase their current intake of vegetables by two portions daily. In both of these challenges, audience members are being asked to go out of their way to do something different that involves effort on their part.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Conclude with a Quotation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s02_p01">A second way you can conclude a speech is by reciting a quotation relevant to the speech topic. When using a quotation, you need to think about whether your goal is to end on a persuasive note or an informative note. Some quotations will have a clear call to action, while other quotations summarize or provoke thought. For example, let’s say you are delivering an informative speech about dissident writers in the former Soviet Union. You could end by citing this quotation from Alexander Solzhenitsyn: “A great writer is, so to speak, a second government in his country. And for that reason no regime has ever loved great writers.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn11_004">Solzhenitsyn, A. (1964). <em class="emphasis">The first circle.</em> New York: Harper &amp; Row. Cited in Bartlett, J., &amp; Kaplan, J. (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Bartlett’s familiar quotations</em> (6th ed.). Boston, MA: Little, Brown &amp; Co., p. 746.</span> Notice that this quotation underscores the idea of writers as dissidents, but it doesn’t ask listeners to put forth effort to engage in any specific thought process or behavior. If, on the other hand, you were delivering a persuasive speech urging your audience to participate in a very risky political demonstration, you might use this quotation from Martin Luther King Jr.: “If a man hasn’t discovered something that he will die for, he isn’t fit to live.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn11_005">King, M. L. (1963, June 23). Speech in Detroit. Cited in Bartlett, J., &amp; Kaplan, J. (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Bartlett’s familiar quotations</em> (6th ed.). Boston, MA: Little, Brown &amp; Co., p. 760.</span> In this case, the quotation leaves the audience with the message that great risks are worth taking, that they make our lives worthwhile, and that the right thing to do is to go ahead and take that great risk.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Conclude with a Summary</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s03_p01">When a speaker ends with a summary, he or she is simply elongating the review of the main points. While this may not be the most exciting concluding device, it can be useful for information that was highly technical or complex or for speeches lasting longer than thirty minutes. Typically, for short speeches (like those in your class), this summary device should be avoided.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Conclude by Visualizing the Future</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s04_p01">The purpose of a conclusion that refers to the future is to help your audience imagine the future you believe can occur. If you are giving a speech on the development of video games for learning, you could conclude by depicting the classroom of the future where video games are perceived as true learning tools and how those tools could be utilized. More often, speakers use visualization of the future to depict how society would be, or how individual listeners’ lives would be different, if the speaker’s persuasive attempt worked. For example, if a speaker proposes that a solution to illiteracy is hiring more reading specialists in public schools, the speaker could ask her or his audience to imagine a world without illiteracy. In this use of visualization, the goal is to persuade people to adopt the speaker’s point of view. By showing that the speaker’s vision of the future is a positive one, the conclusion should help to persuade the audience to help create this future.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Conclude with an Appeal for Action</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s05_p01">Probably the most common persuasive concluding device is the appeal for action or the call to action. In essence, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">appeal for action</a><span class="glossdef">When a speaker asks her or his audience to engage in a specific behavior or change in thinking.</span></span> occurs when a speaker asks her or his audience to engage in a specific behavior or change in thinking. When a speaker concludes by asking the audience “to do” or “to think” in a specific manner, the speaker wants to see an actual change. Whether the speaker appeals for people to eat more fruit, buy a car, vote for a candidate, oppose the death penalty, or sing more in the shower, the speaker is asking the audience to engage in action.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s05_p02">One specific type of appeal for action is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">immediate call to action</a><span class="glossdef">When a speaker asks the audience to engage in a specific behavior immediately following the conclusion of a speech.</span></span>. Whereas some appeals ask for people to engage in behavior in the future, the immediate call to action asks people to engage in behavior right now. If a speaker wants to see a new traffic light placed at a dangerous intersection, he or she may conclude by asking all the audience members to sign a digital petition right then and there, using a computer the speaker has made available (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.petitiononline.com">http://www.petitiononline.com</a>). Here are some more examples of immediate calls to action:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s05_l01">
                <li>In a speech on eating more vegetables, pass out raw veggies and dip at the conclusion of the speech.</li>
                <li>In a speech on petitioning a lawmaker for a new law, provide audience members with a prewritten e-mail they can send to the lawmaker.</li>
                <li>In a speech on the importance of using hand sanitizer, hand out little bottles of hand sanitizer and show audience members how to correctly apply the sanitizer.</li>
                <li>In a speech asking for donations for a charity, send a box around the room asking for donations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s05_p03">These are just a handful of different examples we’ve actually seen students use in our classrooms to elicit an immediate change in behavior. These immediate calls to action may not lead to long-term change, but they can be very effective at increasing the likelihood that an audience will change behavior in the short term.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s06">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Conclude by Inspiration</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s06_p01">By definition, the word <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inspire</a><span class="glossdef">To affect or arouse someone.</span></span> means to affect or arouse someone. Both affect and arouse have strong emotional connotations. The ultimate goal of an inspiration concluding device is similar to an “appeal for action” but the ultimate goal is more lofty or ambiguous; the goal is to stir someone’s emotions in a specific manner. Maybe a speaker is giving an informative speech on the prevalence of domestic violence in our society today. That speaker could end the speech by reading Paulette Kelly’s powerful poem “I Got Flowers Today.” “I Got Flowers Today” is a poem that evokes strong emotions because it’s about an abuse victim who received flowers from her abuser every time she was victimized. The poem ends by saying, “I got flowers today… / Today was a special day—it was the day of my funeral / Last night he killed me.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn11_006">Kelly, P. (1994). I got flowers today. In C. J. Palmer &amp; J. Palmer, <em class="emphasis">Fire from within</em>. Painted Post, NY: Creative Arts &amp; Science Enterprises.</span></p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s07">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Conclude with Advice</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s07_p01">The next concluding device is one that should be used primarily by speakers who are recognized as expert authorities on a given subject. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Advice</a><span class="glossdef">A speaker’s opinion about what should or should not be done.</span></span> is essentially a speaker’s opinion about what should or should not be done. The problem with opinions is that everyone has one, and one person’s opinion is not necessarily any more correct than another’s. There needs to be a really good reason your opinion—and therefore your advice—should matter to your audience. If, for example, you are an expert in nuclear physics, you might conclude a speech on energy by giving advice about the benefits of nuclear energy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s08">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Conclude by Proposing a Solution</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s08_p01">Another way a speaker can conclude a speech powerfully is to offer a solution to the problem discussed within a speech. For example, perhaps a speaker has been discussing the problems associated with the disappearance of art education in the United States. The speaker could then propose a solution of creating more community-based art experiences for school children as a way to fill this gap. Although this can be an effective conclusion, a speaker must ask herself or himself whether the solution should be discussed in more depth as a stand-alone main point within the body of the speech so that audience concerns about the proposed solution may be addressed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s09">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Conclude with a Question</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s09_p01">Another way you can end a speech is to ask a rhetorical question that forces the audience to ponder an idea. Maybe you are giving a speech on the importance of the environment, so you end the speech by saying, “Think about your children’s future. What kind of world do you want them raised in? A world that is clean, vibrant, and beautiful—or one that is filled with smog, pollution, filth, and disease?” Notice that you aren’t actually asking the audience to verbally or nonverbally answer the question; the goal of this question is to force the audience into thinking about what kind of world they want for their children.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s10">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Conclude with a Reference to Audience</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_s10_p01">The last concluding device discussed by Miller (1946) was a reference to one’s audience. This concluding device is when a speaker attempts to answer the basic audience question, “What’s in it for me?” The goal of this concluding device is to spell out the direct benefits a behavior or thought change has for audience members. For example, a speaker talking about stress reduction techniques could conclude by clearly listing all the physical health benefits stress reduction offers (e.g., improved reflexes, improved immune system, improved hearing, reduction in blood pressure). In this case, the speaker is clearly spelling out why audience members should care—what’s in it for them!</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch11_s02_s04_p01">As you read through the ten possible ways to conclude a speech, hopefully you noticed that some of the methods are more appropriate for persuasive speeches and others are more appropriate for informative speeches.

                <li>An effective conclusion contains three basic parts: a restatement of the speech’s thesis; a review of the main points discussed within the speech; and a concluding device that helps create a lasting image in audiences’ minds.</li>
                <li>Miller (1946) found that speakers tend to use one of ten concluding devices. All of these devices are not appropriate for all speeches, so speakers need to determine which concluding device would have the strongest, most powerful effect for a given audience, purpose, and occasion.</li>

                <li>Take the last speech you gave in class and rework the speech’s conclusion to reflect the three parts of a conclusion. Now do the same thing with the speech you are currently working on for class.</li>
                <li>Think about the speech you are currently working on in class. Write out concluding statements using three of the devices discussed in this chapter. Which of the devices would be most useful for your speech? Why?</li>
