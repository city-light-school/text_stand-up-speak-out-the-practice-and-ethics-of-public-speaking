This section is going to provide you with a number of organization patterns to help you create a logically organized speech. The first organization pattern we’ll discuss is categorical/topical.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Categorical/Topical</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s01_p01">By far the most common pattern for organizing a speech is by categories or topics. The categories function as a way to help the speaker organize the message in a consistent fashion. The goal of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">categorical/topical speech pattern</a><span class="glossdef">Speech format in which a speaker organizes the information into categories, which helps an audience understand a single topic.</span></span> is to create categories (or chunks) of information that go together to help support your original specific purpose. Let’s look at an example.</p>
        <div class="informaltable block" frame="all">
            <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Specific Purpose</td>
                        <td>To persuade a group of high school juniors to apply to attend Generic University</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td rowspan="3">Main Points</td>
                        <td>I. Life in the dorms</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>II. Life in the classroom</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>III. Life on campus</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s01_p02">In this case, we have a speaker trying to persuade a group of high school juniors to apply to attend Generic University. To persuade this group, the speaker has divided the information into three basic categories: what it’s like to live in the dorms, what classes are like, and what life is like on campus. Almost anyone could take this basic speech and specifically tailor the speech to fit her or his own university or college. The main points in this example could be rearranged and the organizational pattern would still be effective because there is no inherent logic to the sequence of points. Let’s look at a second example.</p>
        <div class="informaltable block" frame="all">
            <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Specific Purpose</td>
                        <td>To inform a group of college students about the uses and misuses of Internet dating</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td rowspan="3">Main Points</td>
                        <td>I. Define and describe Internet dating.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>II. Explain some strategies to enhance your Internet dating experience.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>III. List some warning signs to look for in potential online dates.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s01_p03">In this speech, the speaker is talking about how to find others online and date them. Specifically, the speaker starts by explaining what Internet dating is; then the speaker talks about how to make Internet dating better for her or his audience members; and finally, the speaker ends by discussing some negative aspects of Internet dating. Again, notice that the information is chunked into three categories or topics and that the second and third could be reversed and still provide a logical structure for your speech</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Comparison/Contrast</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_p01">Another method for organizing main points is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">comparison/contrast speech pattern</a><span class="glossdef">Speech format in which a speaker selects two objects or ideas and demonstrates how they are similar or how they are different.</span></span>. While this pattern clearly lends itself easily to two main points, you can also create a third point by giving basic information about what is being compared and what is being contrasted. Let’s look at two examples; the first one will be a two-point example and the second a three-point example.</p>
        <div class="informaltable block" frame="all">
            <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

                        <td>To inform a group of physicians about Drug X, a newer drug with similar applications to Drug Y</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                        <td>I. Show how Drug X and Drug Y are similar.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>II. Show how Drug X and Drug Y differ.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Specific Purpose</td>
                        <td>To inform a group of physicians about Drug X, a newer drug with similar applications to Drug Y</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td rowspan="3">Main Points</td>
                        <td>I. Explain the basic purpose and use of both Drug X and Drug Y.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>II. Show how Drug X and Drug Y are similar.</td>

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_p02">If you were using the comparison/contrast pattern for persuasive purposes, in the preceding examples, you’d want to make sure that when you show how Drug X and Drug Y differ, you clearly state why Drug X is clearly the better choice for physicians to adopt. In essence, you’d want to make sure that when you compare the two drugs, you show that Drug X has all the benefits of Drug Y, but when you contrast the two drugs, you show how Drug X is superior to Drug Y in some way.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Spatial</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s03_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spatial speech pattern</a><span class="glossdef">Speech format in which a speaker organizes information according to how things fit together in physical space.</span></span> organizes information according to how things fit together in physical space. This pattern is best used when your main points are oriented to different locations that can exist independently. The basic reason to choose this format is to show that the main points have clear locations. We’ll look at two examples here, one involving physical geography and one involving a different spatial order.</p>
        <div class="informaltable block" frame="all">

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s03_p02">If you look at a basic map of the United States, you’ll notice that these groupings of states were created because of their geographic location to one another. In essence, the states create three spatial territories to explain.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s03_p03">Now let’s look at a spatial speech unrelated to geography.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s03_p04">In this example, we still have three basic spatial areas. If you look at a model of the urinary system, the first step is the kidney, which then takes waste through the ureters to the bladder, which then relies on the sphincter muscle to excrete waste through the urethra. All we’ve done in this example is create a spatial speech order for discussing how waste is removed from the human body through the urinary system. It is spatial because the organization pattern is determined by the physical location of each body part in relation to the others discussed.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s06_p04">In this example, the possible causes for the difference might include stricter law enforcement, greater likelihood of neighbors reporting an incident, and police training that emphasizes arrests as opposed to other outcomes. Examining these possible causes may suggest that despite the arrest statistic, the actual number of domestic violence incidents in your city may not be greater than in other cities of similar size.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s07_p02">In this speech, the speaker wants to persuade people to pass a new curfew for people under eighteen. To help persuade the civic group members, the speaker first shows that vandalism and violence are problems in the community. Once the speaker has shown the problem, the speaker then explains to the audience that the cause of this problem is youth outside after 10:00 p.m. Lastly, the speaker provides the mandatory 10:00 p.m. curfew as a solution to the vandalism and violence problem within the community. The problem-cause-solution format for speeches generally lends itself to persuasive topics because the speaker is asking an audience to believe in and adopt a specific solution.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Psychological</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s08_p01">A further way to organize your main ideas within a speech is through a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">psychological speech pattern</a><span class="glossdef">Speech format built on basic logic in which “a” leads to “b” and “b” leads to “c.”</span></span> in which “a” leads to “b” and “b” leads to “c.” This speech format is designed to follow a logical argument, so this format lends itself to persuasive speeches very easily. Let’s look at an example.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s08_p02">In this speech, the speaker starts by discussing how humor affects the body. If a patient is exposed to humor (a), then the patient’s body actually physiologically responds in ways that help healing (b—e.g., reduces stress, decreases blood pressure, bolsters one’s immune system, etc.). Because of these benefits, nurses should engage in humor use that helps with healing (c).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Selecting an Organizational Pattern</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s09_p01">Each of the preceding organizational patterns is potentially useful for organizing the main points of your speech. However, not all organizational patterns work for all speeches. For example, as we mentioned earlier, the biographical pattern is useful when you are telling the story of someone’s life. Some other patterns, particularly comparison/contrast, problem-cause-solution, and psychological, are well suited for persuasive speaking. Your challenge is to choose the best pattern for the particular speech you are giving.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch10_s02_s09_p02">You will want to be aware that it is also possible to combine two or more organizational patterns to meet the goals of a specific speech. For example, you might wish to discuss a problem and then compare/contrast several different possible solutions for the audience. Such a speech would thus be combining elements of the comparison/contrast and problem-cause-solution patterns. When considering which organizational pattern to use, you need to keep in mind your specific purpose as well as your audience and the actual speech material itself to decide which pattern you think will work best.</p>

                <li>Speakers can use a variety of different organizational patterns, including categorical/topical, comparison/contrast, spatial, chronological, biographical, causal, problem-cause-solution, and psychological.
