        <h3 class="title">Speaking Ethically</h3>
        <p class="para" id="wrench_1.0-ch08_s04_p01">While preparing a speech on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Aban runs across a website that has a lot of useful information. The website has numerous articles and links that all discuss the importance of the different functions of the DHS. Being a good speaker, Aban delves into the website to determine the credibility of the information being provided.</p>
        <p class="para" id="wrench_1.0-ch08_s04_p02">Aban quickly realizes that the group sponsoring the website is a fringe-militia group that believes no immigrants should be allowed into the United States. While the information Aban is interested has nothing to do with immigration, he wonders if all the information provided on the website has been distorted to support the organization’s basic cause.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="wrench_1.0-ch08_s04_l01">
            <li>Should Aban use the useful information about DHS even though the other information on the website is from an extremist group?</li>
            <li>Are all sources on the extremist group’s website automatically suspect because of the group’s stated anti-immigration stance?</li>
            <li>Is it ethical for Aban to use any of the information from this website?</li>
            <li>If Aban was a friend of yours and he showed you the website, how would you tell him to proceed?</li>
