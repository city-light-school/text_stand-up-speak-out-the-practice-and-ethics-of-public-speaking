<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 14</span> Delivering the Speech</h1>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_p01">How we deliver a speech is just as important, if not more so, than the basic message we are trying to convey to an audience. But if you have worked hard on preparing the verbal part of your speech, you may feel that delivery is just an “extra” that should not require much time or effort. After all, your speech is carefully planned, researched, and polished. It is committed safely to paper and hard drive. It’s a carefully constructed, logically crafted, ethical message. The words alone should engage your audience’s attention and interest—right?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_p02">After all the work of building such a message, you might wish that you could simply read it to the audience. However, this is the case in only a few kinds of circumstances: when the message is highly technical, complex, and extremely important (as in a new medical discovery); when international protocols and etiquette are crucially important and the world is listening; or when the speaker is representing a high-ranking person, such as a president or a king, who is unable to be present. For the purposes of your public speaking class, you will not be encouraged to read your speech. Instead, you will be asked to give an extemporaneous presentation. We will examine what that means.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_p03">The nonverbal part of your speech is a presentation of yourself as well as your message. Through the use of eye contact, vocal expression, body posture, gestures, and facial display, you enhance your message and invite your audience to give their serious attention to it, and to you. Your credibility, your sincerity, and your knowledge of your speech become apparent through your nonverbal behaviors.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_p04">The interplay between the verbal and nonverbal components of your speech can either bring the message vividly to life or confuse or bore the audience. Therefore, it is best that you neither overdramatize your speech delivery behaviors nor downplay them. This is a balance achieved through rehearsal, trial and error, and experience.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_p05">In this chapter, we are going to examine effective strategies for delivering a speech. To help you enhance your delivery, we will begin by exploring the four basic methods of speech delivery. Second, we will discuss how to prepare your delivery for different environments. Third, we will talk about how to effectively use notes to enhance your delivery. Finally, we will examine characteristics of good delivery and give some strategies for practicing effectively for the day when you will deliver your speech.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_p01">The easiest approach to speech delivery is not always the best. Substantial work goes into the careful preparation of an interesting and ethical message, so it is understandable that students may have the impulse to avoid “messing it up” by simply reading it word for word. But students who do this miss out on one of the major reasons for studying public speaking: to learn ways to “connect” with one’s audience and to increase one’s confidence in doing so. You already know how to read, and you already know how to talk. But public speaking is neither reading nor talking.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_p02">Speaking in public has more formality than talking. During a speech, you should present yourself professionally. This doesn’t mean you must wear a suit or “dress up” (unless your instructor asks you to), but it does mean making yourself presentable by being well groomed and wearing clean, appropriate clothes. It also means being prepared to use language correctly and appropriately for the audience and the topic, to make eye contact with your audience, and to look like you know your topic very well.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_p03">While speaking has more formality than talking, it has less formality than reading. Speaking allows for meaningful pauses, eye contact, small changes in word order, and vocal emphasis. Reading is a more or less exact replication of words on paper without the use of any nonverbal interpretation. Speaking, as you will realize if you think about excellent speakers you have seen and heard, provides a more animated message.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_p04">The next sections introduce four methods of delivery that can help you balance between too much and too little formality when giving a public speech.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Impromptu Speaking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Impromptu speaking</a><span class="glossdef">The presentation of a short message without advance preparation.</span></span> is the presentation of a short message without advance preparation. Impromptu speeches often occur when someone is asked to “say a few words” or give a toast on a special occasion. You have probably done impromptu speaking many times in informal, conversational settings. Self-introductions in group settings are examples of impromptu speaking: “Hi, my name is Steve, and I’m a volunteer with the Homes for the Brave program.” Another example of impromptu speaking occurs when you answer a question such as, “What did you think of the documentary?”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p02">The advantage of this kind of speaking is that it’s spontaneous and responsive in an animated group context. The disadvantage is that the speaker is given little or no time to contemplate the central theme of his or her message. As a result, the message may be disorganized and difficult for listeners to follow.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p03">Here is a step-by-step guide that may be useful if you are called upon to give an impromptu speech in public.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>Take a moment to collect your thoughts and plan the main point you want to make.</li>
            <li>Thank the person for inviting you to speak.</li>
            <li>Deliver your message, making your main point as briefly as you can while still covering it adequately and at a pace your listeners can follow.</li>
            <li>Thank the person again for the opportunity to speak.</li>
            <li>Stop talking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p04">As you can see, impromptu speeches are generally most successful when they are brief and focus on a single point.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Extemporaneous Speaking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Extemporaneous speaking</a><span class="glossdef">The presentation of a carefully planned and rehearsed speech using brief notes, spoken in a conversational manner.</span></span> is the presentation of a carefully planned and rehearsed speech, spoken in a conversational manner using brief notes. By using notes rather than a full manuscript, the extemporaneous speaker can establish and maintain eye contact with the audience and assess how well they are understanding the speech as it progresses. The opportunity to assess is also an opportunity to restate more clearly any idea or concept that the audience seems to have trouble grasping.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s02_p02">For instance, suppose you are speaking about workplace safety and you use the term “sleep deprivation.” If you notice your audience’s eyes glazing over, this might not be a result of their own sleep deprivation, but rather an indication of their uncertainty about what you mean. If this happens, you can add a short explanation; for example, “sleep deprivation is sleep loss serious enough to threaten one’s cognition, hand-to-eye coordination, judgment, and emotional health.” You might also (or instead) provide a concrete example to illustrate the idea. Then you can resume your message, having clarified an important concept.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s02_p03">Speaking extemporaneously has some advantages. It promotes the likelihood that you, the speaker, will be perceived as knowledgeable and credible. In addition, your audience is likely to pay better attention to the message because it is engaging both verbally and nonverbally. The disadvantage of extemporaneous speaking is that it requires a great deal of preparation for both the verbal and the nonverbal components of the speech. Adequate preparation cannot be achieved the day before you’re scheduled to speak.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s02_p04">Because extemporaneous speaking is the style used in the great majority of public speaking situations, most of the information in this chapter is targeted to this kind of speaking.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Speaking from a Manuscript</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s03_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Manuscript speaking</a><span class="glossdef">The word-for-word iteration of a written message.</span></span> is the word-for-word iteration of a written message. In a manuscript speech, the speaker maintains his or her attention on the printed page except when using visual aids.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s03_p02">The advantage to reading from a manuscript is the exact repetition of original words. As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, in some circumstances this can be extremely important. For example, reading a statement about your organization’s legal responsibilities to customers may require that the original words be exact. In reading one word at a time, in order, the only errors would typically be mispronunciation of a word or stumbling over complex sentence structure.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s03_p03">However, there are costs involved in manuscript speaking. First, it’s typically an uninteresting way to present. Unless the speaker has rehearsed the reading as a complete performance animated with vocal expression and gestures (as poets do in a poetry slam and actors do in a reader’s theater), the presentation tends to be dull. Keeping one’s eyes glued to the script precludes eye contact with the audience. For this kind of “straight” manuscript speech to hold audience attention, the audience must be already interested in the message before the delivery begins.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s03_p04">It is worth noting that professional speakers, actors, news reporters, and politicians often read from an autocue device, such as a TelePrompTer, especially when appearing on television, where eye contact with the camera is crucial. With practice, a speaker can achieve a conversational tone and give the impression of speaking extemporaneously while using an autocue device. However, success in this medium depends on two factors: (1) the speaker is already an accomplished public speaker who has learned to use a conversational tone while delivering a prepared script, and (2) the speech is written in a style that sounds conversational.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Speaking from Memory</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s04_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Memorized speaking</a><span class="glossdef">The rote recitation of a memorized written message.</span></span> is the rote recitation of a written message that the speaker has committed to memory. Actors, of course, recite from memory whenever they perform from a script in a stage play, television program, or movie scene. When it comes to speeches, memorization can be useful when the message needs to be exact and the speaker doesn’t want to be confined by notes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s01_s04_p02">The advantage to memorization is that it enables the speaker to maintain eye contact with the audience throughout the speech. Being free of notes means that you can move freely around the stage and use your hands to make gestures. If your speech uses visual aids, this freedom is even more of an advantage. However, there are some real and potential costs. First, unless you also plan and memorize every <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vocal cue</a><span class="glossdef">The subtle but meaningful variations in speech delivery, which can include the use of pitch, tone, volume, and pace.</span></span> (the subtle but meaningful variations in speech delivery, which can include the use of pitch, tone, volume, and pace), gesture, and facial expression, your presentation will be flat and uninteresting, and even the most fascinating topic will suffer. You might end up speaking in a monotone or a sing-song repetitive delivery pattern. You might also present your speech in a rapid “machine-gun” style that fails to emphasize the most important points. Second, if you lose your place and start trying to ad lib, the contrast in your style of delivery will alert your audience that something is wrong. More frighteningly, if you go completely blank during the presentation, it will be extremely difficult to find your place and keep going.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_p01">The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous “I Have a Dream” speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at a gigantic civil rights rally on an August afternoon in 1963. His lectern was bristling with microphones placed there for news coverage and for recording the historic event. His audience, estimated to number a quarter of a million people, extended as far as the eye could see. He was the last speaker of the day, delivering his speech after more than a dozen civil rights leaders and world-famous performers such as Joan Baez, Mahalia Jackson, and Charlton Heston had occupied the stage.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn14_001">Ross, S. (2007). Civil rights march on Washington. <em class="emphasis">Infoplease</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/marchonwashington.html">http://www.infoplease.com/spot/marchonwashington.html</a></span> King gave us his speech in the assertive ringing tones of inspired vision. Nothing less would have worked that day.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_p02">Most of us will never speak to so many people at once. Even an appearance on television will probably command a much smaller audience than the crowd that heard King’s speech. Even though you don’t expect an audience of such size or a setting of such symbolic importance, you should still be prepared to adapt to the setting in which you will speak.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_p03">Our audiences, circumstances, and physical contexts for public speaking will vary. At some point in your life you may run for public office or rise to a leadership role in a business or volunteer organization. Or you may be responsible for informing coworkers about a new policy, regulation, or opportunity. You may be asked to deliver remarks in the context of a worship service, wedding, or funeral. You may be asked to introduce a keynote speaker or simply to make an important announcement in some context. Sometimes you will speak in a familiar environment, while at other times you may be faced with an unfamiliar location and very little time to get used to speaking with a microphone. These are contexts and situations we address in the following subsections.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Lecterns</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">lectern</a><span class="glossdef">A small raised surface, usually with a slanted top, where a speaker can place his or her notes during a speech.</span></span> is a small raised surface, usually with a slanted top, where a speaker can place notes during a speech. While a lectern adds a measure of formality to the speaking situation, it allows speakers the freedom to do two things: to come out from behind the lectern to establish more immediate contact with the audience and to use both hands for gestures.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_p02">However, for new speakers who feel anxious, it is all too tempting to grip the edges of the lectern with both hands for security. You might even wish you could hide behind it. Be aware of these temptations so you can manage them effectively and present yourself to your audience in a manner they will perceive as confident. One way to achieve this is by limiting your use of the lectern to simply a place to rest your notes. Try stepping to the side or front of the lectern when speaking with free hands, only occasionally standing at the lectern to consult your notes. This will enhance your eye contact as well as free up your hands for gesturing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Speaking in a Small or Large Physical Space</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s02_p01">If you are accustomed to being in a classroom of a certain size, you will need to make adjustments when speaking in a smaller or larger space than what you are used to.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s02_p02">A large auditorium can be intimidating, especially for speakers who feel shy and “exposed” when facing an audience. However, the maxim that “proper preparation prevents poor performance” is just as true here as anywhere. If you have prepared and practiced well, you can approach a large-venue speaking engagement with confidence. In terms of practical adjustments, be aware that your voice is likely to echo, so you will want to speak more slowly than usual and make use of pauses to mark the ends of phrases and sentences. Similarly, your facial expressions and gestures should be larger so that they are visible from farther away. If you are using visual aids, they need to be large enough to be visible from the back of the auditorium.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s02_p03">Limited space is not as disconcerting for most speakers as enormous space, but it has the advantage of minimizing the tendency to pace back and forth while you speak. We have all seen dramatic soliloquies in the movies and plays where an actor makes use of the space on the stage, but this is generally not a good strategy for a speech. A small space also calls for more careful management of notecards and visual aids, as your audience will be able to see up close what you are doing with your hands. Do your best to minimize fumbling, including setting up in advance or arriving early to decide how to organize your materials in the physical space. We will discuss visual aids further in <a class="xref" href="wrench_1.0-ch15#wrench_1.0-ch15">Chapter 15 "Presentation Aids: Design and Usage"</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Speaking Outdoors</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s03_p01">Outdoor settings can be charming, but they are prone to distractions. If you’re giving a speech in a setting that is picturesquely beautiful, it may be difficult to maintain the audience’s attention. If you know this ahead of time, you might plan your speech to focus more on mood than information and perhaps to make reference to the lovely view.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s03_p02">More typically, outdoor speech venues can pose challenges with weather, sun glare, and uninvited guests, such as ants and pigeons. If the venue is located near a busy highway, it might be difficult to make yourself heard over the ambient noise. You might lack the usual accommodations, such as a lectern or table. Whatever the situation, you will need to use your best efforts to project your voice clearly without sounding like you’re yelling.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using a Microphone</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s04_p01">Most people today are familiar with microphones that are built into video recorders and other electronic devices, but they may be new at using a microphone to deliver a speech. One overall principle to remember is that a microphone only amplifies, it does not clarify. If you are not enunciating clearly, the microphone will merely enable your audience to hear amplified mumbling.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s04_p02">Microphones come in a wide range of styles and sizes. Generally, the easiest microphone to use is the clip-on style worn on the front of your shirt. If you look closely at many television personalities and news anchors, you will notice these tiny microphones clipped to their clothing. They require very little adaptation. You simply have to avoid looking down—at your notes, for instance—because your voice will be amplified when you do so.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s04_p03">Lectern and handheld microphones require more adaptation. If they’re too close to your mouth, they can screech. If they’re too far away, they might not pick up your voice. Some microphones are directional, meaning that they are only effective when you speak directly into them. If there is any opportunity to do so, ask for tips about how to use a particular microphone and practice with it for a few minutes while you have someone listen from a middle row in the audience and signal whether you can be heard well. The best plan, of course, would be to have access to the microphone for practice ahead of the speaking date.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s04_p04">Often a microphone is provided when it isn’t necessary. If the room is small or the audience is close to you, do not feel obligated to use the microphone. Sometimes an amplified voice can feel less natural and less compelling than a direct voice. However, if you forgo the microphone, make sure to speak loudly enough for all audience members to hear you—not just those in front.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Audience Size</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s05_p01">A small audience is an opportunity for a more intimate, minimally formal tone. If your audience has only eight to twelve people, you can generate greater audience contact. Make use of all the preparation you have done. You do not have to revamp your speech just because the audience is small. When the presentation is over, there will most likely be opportunities to answer questions and have individual contact with your listeners.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s05_p02">Your classroom audience may be as many as twenty to thirty students. The format for an audience of this size is still formal but conversational. Depending on how your instructor structures the class, you may or may not be asked to leave time after your speech for questions and answers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s02_s05_p03">Some audiences are much larger. If you have an audience that fills an auditorium, or if you have an auditorium with only a few people in it, you still have a clearly formal task, and you should be guided as much as possible by your preparation.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_p01">It’s a great deal of work to prepare a good speech, and you want to present it effectively so that your audience will benefit as much as possible. We’ve already said that extemporaneous speaking provides the best opportunity for speaker-audience contact and that speaking extemporaneously means you do not have your full manuscript or outline with you. Instead, you will use notecards. The cards should have notes, not the full text of your speech. This can also be done with an autocue device—the TelePrompTer does not have to provide a full word-for-word script.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_p02">We have developed a system for creating highly effective notecards. Our system has been used effectively both in public speaking courses and in freshman composition courses. Surprisingly, the system consists of only five cards. For many people, this does not sound like nearly enough cards. We would make the case that you can do a good job with five cards, and we have seen many students do just that.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Purpose of Speaker Notes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s01_p01">Using notes adds to your credibility as a speaker. If you depend on a full manuscript to get through your delivery, your listeners might believe you don’t know the content of your speech. Second, the temptation to read the entire speech directly from a manuscript, even if you’re only carrying it as a safety net, is nearly overwhelming. Third, well-prepared cards are more gracefully handled than sheets of paper, and they don’t rattle if your hands tremble from nervousness. Finally, cards look better than sheets of paper. Five carefully prepared cards, together with practice, will help you more than you might think.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Key Tips for Using Notes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s02_p01">Plan on using just five cards, written on one side only. Get 4 × 6 cards. Use one card for the introduction, one card for each of your three main points, and one card for the conclusion.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Include Only Key Words</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s02_s01_p01">Your cards should include key words and phrases, not full sentences. The words and phrases should be arranged in order so that you can stay organized and avoid forgetting important points.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s02_s01_p02">One exception to the key word guideline would be an extended or highly technical quotation from an authoritative source. If it is critically important to present an exact quotation, you may add one additional card that will contain the quotation together with its citation. If you plan to use such a quotation, make sure it has central importance in your speech.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Hold Your Notes Naturally</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s02_s02_p01">Notes are a normal part of giving a presentation. You do not need to conceal them from the audience; in fact, trying to hide and use your notes at the same time tends to be very awkward and distracting. Some instructors recommend that you avoid gesturing with your notes on the grounds that nervous shaking is more noticeable if you are holding your notes in your hand. If this is the case for you, practice gesturing with your free hand, or put your cards down if you need to use both hands. Other instructors recommend treating notecards as a natural extension of your hand, as they believe it is distracting to put your notes down and pick them up again. Whichever “rule” you follow, remember that the goal is for your use of notecards to contribute to your overall appearance of confidence and credibility.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Prepare Notecards to Trigger Recall</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s02_s03_p01">The “trick” to selecting the words to write on your cards is to identify the keywords that will trigger a recall sequence. For instance, if the word “Fukushima” brings to mind the nuclear power plant meltdown that followed the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011, then that one word on your notecard should propel you through a sizable sequence of points and details. Once you have delivered that material, perhaps you’ll glance at your card again to remind yourself of the key word or phrase that comes next.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s02_s03_p02">You must discover what works for you and then select those words that tend to jog your recall. Having identified what works, make a preliminary set of five cards, written on one side only. Number the cards, and practice with them. Revise and refine them the way you would an outline. If you must, rewrite an entire card to make it work better, and test it the next time you practice.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s02_s03_p03">Always practice with your notecards—and with any visual aids you plan to use. Practicing is also the best way to find out what kinds of things might go wrong with your notes in the presented speech and what steps you should take to make things go smoothly.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Write in Large Letters</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s02_s04_p01">You should be able to read something on your card by glancing, not peering at it. A few key words and phrases, written in large, bold print with plenty of white space between them, will help you. If the lighting in your speech location is likely to have glare, be sure to write your notes in ink, as pencil can be hard to read in poor lighting.</p>

    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Notecards Effectively</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s03_p01">If you use as much care in developing your five notecards as you do your speech, they should serve you well. If you lose your place or go blank during the speech, you will only need a few seconds to find where you were and get going again. For instance, if you know that you presented the introduction and the first main point, which centers on the Emancipation Proclamation, you can readily go to your second card and remind yourself that your next main point is about the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s03_p02">In addition, the use of your notecards allows you to depart from the exact prepared wordings in your manuscript. In your recovery from losing your place, you can transpose a word or phrase to make your recovery graceful. It allows you to avoid feeling pressured to say every single word in your manuscript.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s03_s03_p03">Under no circumstances should you ever attempt to put your entire speech on cards in little tiny writing. You will end up reading words to your audience instead of telling them your meaning, and the visual aspect of your speech will be spoiled by your need to squint to read your cards.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_p01">There is no foolproof recipe for good delivery. Each of us is unique, and we each embody different experiences and interests. This means each person has an approach, or a style, that is effective for her or him. This further means that anxiety can accompany even the most carefully researched and interesting message. Even when we know our messages are strong and well-articulated on paper, it is difficult to know for sure that our presentation will also be good.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_p02">We are still obligated to do our best out of respect for the audience and their needs. Fortunately, there are some tools that can be helpful to you even the very first time you present a speech. You will continue developing your skills each time you put them to use and can experiment to find out which combination of delivery elements is most effective for you.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is Good Delivery?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_p01">The more you care about your topic, the greater your motivation to present it well. Good delivery is a process of presenting a clear, coherent message in an interesting way. Communication scholar Stephen E. Lucas tells us:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_p02">Good delivery…conveys the speaker’s ideas clearly, interestingly, and without distracting the audience. Most audiences prefer delivery that combines a certain degree of formality with the best attributes of good conversation—directness, spontaneity, animation, vocal and facial expressiveness, and a lively sense of communication. <span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn14_002">Lucas, S. E. (2009). <em class="emphasis">The art of public speaking</em> (9th ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill, p. 244.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_p03">Many writers on the nonverbal aspects of delivery have cited the findings of psychologist Albert Mehrabian, asserting that the bulk of an audience’s understanding of your message is based on nonverbal communication. Specifically, Mehrabian is often credited with finding that when audiences decoded a speaker’s meaning, the speaker’s face conveyed 55 percent of the information, the vocalics conveyed 38 percent, and the words conveyed just 7 percent.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn14_003">Mehrabian, A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_p04">In this section of the chapter, we will explain six elements of good delivery: conversational style, conversational quality, eye contact, vocalics, physical manipulation, and variety. And since delivery is only as good as the practice that goes into it, we conclude with some tips for effective use of your practice time.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Conversational Style</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Conversational style</a><span class="glossdef">A speaker’s ability to sound expressive and be perceived by the audience as natural.</span></span> is a speaker’s ability to sound expressive and to be perceived by the audience as natural. It’s a style that approaches the way you normally express yourself in a much smaller group than your classroom audience. This means that you want to avoid having your presentation come across as didactic or overly exaggerated. You might not feel natural while you’re using a conversational style, but for the sake of audience preference and receptiveness, you should do your best to appear natural. It might be helpful to remember that the two most important elements of the speech are the message and the audience. You are the conduit with the important role of putting the two together in an effective way. Your audience should be thinking about the message, not the delivery.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s01_p02">Stephen E. Lucas defines <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conversational quality</a><span class="glossdef">A speaker’s ability to prepare a speech and rehearse a speech but still sound spontaneous when delivering the speech.</span></span> as the idea that “no matter how many times a speech has been rehearsed, it still <em class="emphasis">sounds</em> spontaneous” [emphasis in original].<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn14_005">Lucas, S. E. (2009). <em class="emphasis">The art of public speaking</em> (9th ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill, p. 247.</span> No one wants to hear a speech that is so well rehearsed that it sounds fake or robotic. One of the hardest parts of public speaking is rehearsing to the point where it can appear to your audience that the thoughts are magically coming to you while you’re speaking, but in reality you’ve spent a great deal of time thinking through each idea. When you can sound conversational, people pay attention.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Eye Contact</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Eye contact</a><span class="glossdef">A speaker’s ability to have visual contact with everyone in his or her audience.</span></span> is a speaker’s ability to have visual contact with everyone in the audience. Your audience should feel that you’re speaking to them, not simply uttering main and supporting points. If you are new to public speaking, you may find it intimidating to look audience members in the eye, but if you think about speakers you have seen who did not maintain eye contact, you’ll realize why this aspect of speech delivery is important. Without eye contact, the audience begins to feel invisible and unimportant, as if the speaker is just speaking to hear her or his own voice. Eye contact lets your audience feel that your attention is on them, not solely on the cards in front of you.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s02_p02">Sustained eye contact with your audience is one of the most important tools toward effective delivery. O’Hair, Stewart, and Rubenstein note that eye contact is mandatory for speakers to establish a good relationship with an audience.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn14_006">O’Hair, D., Stewart, R., &amp; Rubenstein, H. (2001). <em class="emphasis">A speaker’s guidebook: Text and reference.</em> Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin’s.</span> Whether a speaker is speaking before a group of five or five hundred, the appearance of eye contact is an important way to bring an audience into your speech.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s02_p03">Eye contact can be a powerful tool. It is not simply a sign of sincerity, a sign of being well prepared and knowledgeable, or a sign of confidence; it also has the power to convey meanings. Arthur Koch tells us that all facial expressions “can communicate a wide range of emotions, including sadness, compassion, concern, anger, annoyance, fear, joy, and happiness.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn14_007">Koch, A. (2010). <em class="emphasis">Speaking with a purpose</em> (8th ed.). Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon, p. 233.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s02_p04">If you find the gaze of your audience too intimidating, you might feel tempted to resort to “faking” eye contact with them by looking at the wall just above their heads or by sweeping your gaze around the room instead of making actual eye contact with individuals in your audience until it becomes easier to provide real contact. The problem with fake eye contact is that it tends to look mechanical. Another problem with fake attention is that you lose the opportunity to assess the audience’s understanding of your message. Still, fake eye contact is somewhat better than gripping your cards and staring at them and only occasionally glancing quickly and shallowly at the audience.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s02_p05">This is not to say that you may never look at your notecards. On the contrary, one of the skills in extemporaneous speaking is the ability to alternate one’s gaze between the audience and one’s notes. Rehearsing your presentation in front of a few friends should help you develop the ability to maintain eye contact with your audience while referring to your notes. When you are giving a speech that is well prepared and well rehearsed, you will only need to look at your notes occasionally. This is an ability that will develop even further with practice. Your public speaking course is your best chance to get that practice.</p>

This means that you speak loudly enough for all audience members (even those in the back of the room) to hear you clearly, and that you enunciate clearly enough to be understood by all audience members (even those who may have a hearing impairment or who may be English-language learners). If you tend to be soft-spoken, you will need to practice using a louder volume level that may feel unnatural to you at first. For all speakers, good vocalic technique is best achieved by facing the audience with your chin up and your eyes away from your notecards and by setting your voice at a moderate speed. Effective use of vocalics also means that you make use of appropriate pitch, pauses, vocal variety, and correct pronunciation.</p>

In addition, you can use volume strategically to emphasize the most important points in your speech. Select these points carefully; if you emphasize everything, nothing will seem important. You also want to be sure to adjust your volume to the physical setting of the presentation. If you are in a large auditorium and your audience is several yards away, you will need to speak louder. If you are in a smaller space, with the audience a few feet away, you want to avoid overwhelming your audience with shouting or speaking too loudly.</p>

To keep your speech delivery interesting, your rate should vary. If you are speaking extemporaneously, your rate will naturally fluctuate. If you’re reading, your delivery is less likely to vary. Because rate is an important tool in enhancing the meanings in your speech, you do not want to give a monotone drone or a rapid “machine-gun” style delivery. Your rate should be appropriate for your topic and your points. A rapid, lively rate can communicate such meanings as enthusiasm, urgency, or humor. A slower, moderated rate can convey respect, seriousness, or careful reasoning. By varying rapid and slower rates within a single speech, you can emphasize your main points and keep your audience interested.</p>

Some speakers have deep voices and others have high voices. As with one’s singing voice range, the pitch of one’s speaking voice is determined to a large extent by physiology (specifically, the length of one’s vocal folds, or cords, and the size of one’s vocal tract). We all have a normal speaking pitch where our voice is naturally settled, the pitch where we are most comfortable speaking, and most teachers advise speaking at the pitch that feels natural to you.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s03_s03_p02">While our voices may be generally comfortable at a specific pitch level, we all have the ability to modulate, or move, our pitch up or down. In fact, we do this all the time. When we change the pitch of our voices, we are using <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inflections</a><span class="glossdef">Changes in the pitch of a speaker’s voice.</span></span>. Just as you can use volume strategically, you can also use pitch inflections to make your delivery more interesting and emphatic. If you ordinarily speak with a soprano voice, you may want to drop your voice to a slightly lower range to call attention to a particular point. How we use inflections can even change the entire meaning of what we are saying. For example, try saying the sentence “I love public speaking” with a higher pitch on one of the words—first raise the pitch on “I,” then say it again with the pitch raised on “love,” and so on. “<em class="emphasis">I</em> love public speaking” conveys a different meaning from “I love <em class="emphasis">public</em> speaking,” doesn’t it?</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s03_s03_p03">There are some speakers who don’t change their pitch at all while speaking, which is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">monotone</a><span class="glossdef">The vocal quality of staying at a constant pitch level without inflections.</span></span>. While very few people are completely monotone, some speakers slip into monotone patterns because of nerves. One way to ascertain whether you sound monotone is to record your voice and see how you sound. If you notice that your voice doesn’t fluctuate very much, you will need to be intentional in altering your pitch to ensure that the emphasis of your speech isn’t completely lost on your audience.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s03_s03_p04">Finally, resist the habit of pitching your voice “up” at the ends of sentences. It makes them sound like questions instead of statements. This habit can be disorienting and distracting, interfering with the audience’s ability to focus entirely on the message. The speaker sounds uncertain or sounds as though he or she is seeking the understanding or approval of the listener. It hurts the speaker’s credibility and it needs to be avoided.</p>

And if the speaker is uncomfortable, the discomfort can transmit itself to the audience. That doesn’t mean you should avoid using pauses; your ability to use them confidently will increase with practice. Some of the best comedians use the well-timed pause to powerful and hilarious effect. Although your speech will not be a comedy routine, pauses are still useful for emphasis, especially when combined with a lowered pitch and rate to emphasize the important point you do not want your audience to miss.</p>

When you think about how you sound in a normal conversation, your use of volume, pitch, rate, and pauses are all done spontaneously. If you try to overrehearse your vocalics, your speech will end up sounding artificial. Vocal variety should flow naturally from your wish to speak with expression.

If there is any possibility at all that you don’t know the correct pronunciation of a word, find out. Many online dictionaries, such as the Wiktionary (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://wiktionary.org">http://wiktionary.org</a>), provide free sound files illustrating the pronunciation of words.</p>

There have been classroom examples as well. For instance, a student giving a speech on the Greek philosopher Socrates mispronounced his name at least eight times during her speech. This mispronunciation created a situation of great awkwardness and anxiety for the audience. Everyone felt embarrassed and the teacher, opting not to humiliate the student in front of the class, could not say anything out loud, instead providing a private written comment at the end of class.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s04_p01">In addition to using our voices effectively, a key to effective public speaking is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">physical manipulation</a><span class="glossdef">The use of the body to emphasize meanings or convey meanings during a speech.</span></span>, or the use of the body to emphasize meanings or convey meanings during a speech. While we will not attempt to give an entire discourse on nonverbal communication, we will discuss a few basic aspects of physical manipulation: posture, body movement, facial expressions, and dress. These aspects add up to the overall physical dimension of your speech, which we call self-presentation.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s04_s01_p01">“Stand up tall!” I’m sure we’ve all heard this statement from a parent or a teacher at some point in our lives. The fact is, posture is actually quite important. When you stand up straight, you communicate to your audience, without saying a word, that you hold a position of power and take your position seriously. If however, you are slouching, hunched over, or leaning on something, you could be perceived as ill prepared, anxious, lacking in credibility, or not serious about your responsibilities as a speaker. While speakers often assume more casual posture as a presentation continues (especially if it is a long one, such as a ninety-minute class lecture), it is always wise to start by standing up straight and putting your best foot forward. Remember, you only get one shot at making a first impression, and your body’s orientation is one of the first pieces of information audiences use to make that impression.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Body Movement</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s04_s02_p01">Unless you are stuck behind a podium because of the need to use a nonmovable microphone, you should never stand in one place during a speech. However, movement during a speech should also not resemble pacing. One of our authors once saw a speaker who would walk around a small table where her speaking notes were located. She would walk around the table once, toss her chalk twice, and then repeat the process. Instead of listening to what the speaker was saying, everyone became transfixed by her walk-and-chalk-toss pattern. As speakers, we must be mindful of how we go about moving while speaking. One common method for easily integrating some movement into your speech is to take a few steps any time you transition from one idea to the next. By only moving at transition points, not only do you help focus your audience’s attention on the transition from one idea to the next, but you also are able to increase your nonverbal immediacy by getting closer to different segments of your audience.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s04_s02_p02">Body movement also includes gestures. These should be neither overdramatic nor subdued. At one extreme, arm-waving and fist-pounding will distract from your message and reduce your credibility. At the other extreme, refraining from the use of gestures is the waste of an opportunity to suggest emphasis, enthusiasm, or other personal connection with your topic.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s04_s02_p03">There are many ways to use gestures. The most obvious are hand gestures, which should be used in moderation at carefully selected times in the speech. If you overuse gestures, they lose meaning. Many late-night comedy parodies of political leaders include patterned, overused gestures or other delivery habits associated with a particular speaker. However, the well-placed use of simple, natural gestures to indicate emphasis, direction, size is usually effective. Normally, a gesture with one hand is enough. Rather than trying to have a gesture for every sentence, use just a few well-planned gestures. It is often more effective to make a gesture and hold it for a few moments than to begin waving your hands and arms around in a series of gestures.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s04_s02_p04">Finally, just as you should avoid pacing, you will also want to avoid other distracting movements when you are speaking. Many speakers have unconscious mannerisms such as twirling their hair, putting their hands in and out of their pockets, jingling their keys, licking their lips, or clicking a pen while speaking. As with other aspects of speech delivery, practicing in front of others will help you become conscious of such distractions and plan ways to avoid doing them.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Facial Expressions</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s04_s03_p01">Faces are amazing things and convey so much information. As speakers, we must be acutely aware of what our face looks like while speaking. While many of us do not look forward to seeing ourselves on videotape, often the only way you can critically evaluate what your face is doing while you are speaking is to watch a recording of your speech. If video is not available, you can practice speaking in front of a mirror.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s04_s03_p02">There are two extremes you want to avoid: no facial expression and overanimated facial expressions. First, you do not want to have a completely blank face while speaking. Some people just do not show much emotion with their faces naturally, but this blankness is often increased when the speaker is nervous. Audiences will react negatively to the message of such a speaker because they will sense that something is amiss. If a speaker is talking about the joys of Disney World and his face doesn’t show any excitement, the audience is going to be turned off to the speaker and his message. On the other extreme end is the speaker whose face looks like that of an exaggerated cartoon character. Instead, your goal is to show a variety of appropriate facial expressions while speaking.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s04_s03_p03">Like vocalics and gestures, facial expression can be used strategically to enhance meaning. A smile or pleasant facial expression is generally appropriate at the beginning of a speech to indicate your wish for a good transaction with your audience. However, you should not smile throughout a speech on drug addiction, poverty, or the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. An inappropriate smile creates confusion about your meaning and may make your audience feel uncomfortable. On the other hand, a serious scowl might look hostile or threatening to audience members and become a distraction from the message. If you keep the meaning of your speech foremost in your mind, you will more readily find the balance in facial expression.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s04_s03_p04">Another common problem some new speakers have is showing only one expression. One of our coauthors competed in speech in college. After one of his speeches (about how people die on amusement park rides), one of his judges pulled him aside and informed him that his speech was “creepy.” Apparently, while speaking about death, our coauthor smiled the entire time. The incongruity between the speech on death and dying and the coauthor’s smile just left the judge a little creeped out. If you are excited in a part of your speech, you should show excitement on your face. On the other hand, if you are at a serious part of your speech, your facial expressions should be serious.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s04_s04_p01">While there are no clear-cut guidelines for how you should dress for every speech you’ll give, dress is still a very important part of how others will perceive you (again, it’s all about the first impression). If you want to be taken seriously, you must present yourself seriously. While we do not advocate dressing up in a suit every time you give a speech, there are definitely times when wearing a suit is appropriate.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s04_s04_p02">One general rule you can use for determining dress is the “step-above rule,” which states that you should dress one step above your audience. If your audience is going to be dressed casually in shorts and jeans, then wear nice casual clothing such as a pair of neatly pressed slacks and a collared shirt or blouse. If, however, your audience is going to be wearing “business casual” attire, then you should probably wear a sport coat, a dress, or a suit. The goal of the step-above rule is to establish yourself as someone to be taken seriously. On the other hand, if you dress two steps above your audience, you may put too much distance between yourself and your audience, coming across as overly formal or even arrogant.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_s04_s04_p03">Another general rule for dressing is to avoid distractions in your appearance. Overly tight or revealing garments, over-the-top hairstyles or makeup, jangling jewelry, or a display of tattoos and piercings can serve to draw your audience’s attention away from your speech. Remembering that your message is the most important aspect of your speech, keep that message in mind when you choose your clothing and accessories.</p>

In order to develop your best speech delivery, you need to practice—and use your practice time effectively. Practicing does not mean reading over your notes, mentally running through your speech, or even speaking your speech aloud over and over.

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_p02">When you practice your speech, place both your feet in full, firm contact with the floor to keep your body from swaying side to side. Some new public speakers find that they don’t know what to do with their hands during the speech. Your practice sessions should help you get comfortable. When you’re not gesturing, you can rest your free hand lightly on a lectern or simply allow it to hang at your side. Since this is not a familiar posture for most people, it might feel awkward, but in your practice sessions, you can begin getting used to it.</p>

This, of course, is an aspect of your public speaking course, as you will receive evaluations from your instructor and possibly from your fellow students. However, by practicing in front of others before it is time to present your speech, you can anticipate and correct problems so that you can receive a better evaluation when you give the speech “for real.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p02">Ask your practice observers to be honest about the aspects of your delivery that could be better. Sometimes students create study groups just for this purpose. When you create a study group of classroom peers, everyone has an understanding of the entire creative process, and their feedback will thus be more useful to you than the feedback you might get from someone who has never taken the course or given a speech.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p03">If your practice observers seem reluctant to offer useful criticisms, ask questions. How was your eye contact? Could they hear you? Was your voice well modulated? Did you mispronounce any words? How was your posture? Were your gestures effective? Did you have any mannerisms that you should learn to avoid? Because peers are sometimes reluctant to say things that could sound critical, direct questions are often a useful way to help them speak up.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p04">If you learn from these practice sessions that your voice tends to drop at the ends of sentences, make a conscious effort to support your voice as you conclude each main point. If you learn that you have a habit of clicking a pen, make sure you don’t have a pen with you when you speak or that you keep it in your pocket. If your practice observers mention that you tend to hide your hands in the sleeves of your shirt or jacket, next time wear short sleeves or roll your sleeves up before beginning your speech. If you learn through practice that you tend to sway or rock while you speak, you can consciously practice and build the habit of <em class="emphasis">not</em> swaying.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p05">When it is your turn to give feedback to others in your group, assume that they are as interested in doing well as you are. Give feedback in the spirit of helping their speeches be as good as possible.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Use Audio and/or Video to Record Yourself</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p01">Technology has made it easier than ever to record yourself and others using the proliferation of electronic devices people are likely to own. Video, of course, allows you the advantage of being able to see yourself as others see you, while audio allows you to concentrate on the audible aspects of your delivery. As we mentioned earlier in the chapter, if neither video nor audio is available, you can always observe yourself by practicing your delivery in front of a mirror.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p02">After you have recorded yourself, it may seem obvious that you should watch and listen to the recording. This can be intimidating, as you may fear that your performance anxiety will be so obvious that everyone will notice it in the recording. But students are often pleasantly surprised when they watch and listen to their recordings, as even students with very high anxiety may find out that they “come across” in a speech much better than they expected.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p03">A recording can also be a very effective diagnostic device. Sometimes students believe they are making strong contact with their audiences, but their cards contain so many notes that they succumb to the temptation of reading. By finding out from the video that you misjudged your eye contact, you can be motivated to rewrite your notecards in a way that doesn’t provide the opportunity to do so much reading.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p04">It is most likely that in viewing your recording, you will benefit from discovering your strengths and finding weak areas you can strengthen.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Good Delivery Is a Habit</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s03_p01">Luckily, public speaking is an activity that, when done conscientiously, strengthens with practice. As you become aware of the areas where your delivery has room for improvement, you will begin developing a keen sense of what “works” and what audiences respond to.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s03_p02">It is advisable to practice out loud in front of other people several times, spreading your rehearsals out over several days. To do this kind of practice, of course, you need to have your speech be finalized well ahead of the date when you are going to give it. During these practice sessions, you can time your speech to make sure it lasts the appropriate length of time. A friend of ours was the second student on the program in an event where each student’s presentation was to last thirty to forty-five minutes. After the first student had been speaking for seventy-five minutes, the professor in charge asked, “Can we speed this up?” The student said yes, and proceeded to continue speaking for another seventy-five minutes before finally concluding his portion of the program. Although we might fault the professor for not “pulling the plug,” clearly the student had not timed his speech in advance.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s03_p03">Your practice sessions will also enable you to make adjustments to your notecards to make them more effective in supporting your contact with your audience. This kind of practice is not just a strategy for beginners; it is practiced by many highly placed public figures with extensive experience in public speaking.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s03_p04">Your public speaking course is one of the best opportunities you will have to manage your performance anxiety, build your confidence in speaking extemporaneously, develop your vocal skills, and become adept at self-presentation. The habits you can develop through targeted practice are to build continuously on your strengths and to challenge yourself to find new areas for improving your delivery. By taking advantage of these opportunities, you will gain the ability to present a speech effectively whenever you may be called upon to speak publicly.</p>

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="wrench_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s03_l01">
                    <li>Conversational style is a speaker’s ability to sound expressive while being perceived by the audience as natural. Conversational quality is a speaker’s ability to prepare a speech and rehearse a speech but still sound spontaneous when delivering it.</li>
                    <li>Eye contact helps capture and maintain an audience’s interest while contributing to the speaker’s credibility.</li>
                    <li>Vocalics are the nonverbal components of the verbal message. There are six important vocalic components for a speaker to be aware of: volume (loudness or softness), pitch (highness or lowness), rate (fastness or slowness), pauses (use of breaks to add emphasis), vocal variety (use of a range of vocalic strategies), and pronunciation (using conventional patterns of speech formation).</li>
                    <li>Physical manipulation is the use of one’s body to add meaning and emphasis to a speech. As such, excessive or nonexistent physical manipulation can detract from a speaker’s speech.</li>
                    <li>Good delivery is a habit that is built through effective practice.</li>

Two days before the speech, he realized that no matter how hard he worked, his speech would be weak, and he could not do it justice. Instead of choosing a less technical topic or narrowing to one specific kind of medical mistake, he decided to push through it. He could make up for the scant and superficial content by wearing hospital scrubs, borrowed from his brother-in-law, and by sliding his glasses down his nose to make it easier to see his notecards and to match the stereotype of a health care provider.</p>
