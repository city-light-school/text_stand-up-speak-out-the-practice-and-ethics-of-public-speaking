    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_p01">Obviously, there are many different persuasive speech topics you could select for a public speaking class. Anything from localized claims like changing a specific college or university policy to larger societal claims like adding more enforcement against the trafficking of women and children in the United States could make for an interesting persuasive speech. You’ll notice in the previous sentence we referred to the two topics as claims. In this use of the word “claim,” we are declaring the goodness or positivity of an attitude, value, belief, or behavior that others may dispute. As a result of the dispute between our perceptions of the goodness of an attitude, value, belief, or behavior and the perceptions of others, we attempt to support the claim we make using some sort of evidence and logic as we attempt to persuade others. There are four common claims that can be made: definitional, factual, policy, and value.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Definitional Claims</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s01_p01">The first common types of claims that a persuasive speaker can make are definitional or classification claims. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Definitional claims</a><span class="glossdef">Persuasive claim about the denotation or classification of what something is.</span></span> are claims over the denotation or classification of what something is. In essence, we are trying to argue for what something is or what something is not. Most definitional claims falling to a basic argument formula:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><strong class="emphasis bold">X</strong> is (or is not) a <strong class="emphasis bold">Y</strong> because it has (or does not have) features <strong class="emphasis bold">A</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">B</strong>, or <strong class="emphasis bold">C</strong>.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s01_p02">For example, maybe you’re trying to persuade your class that while therapeutic massage is often performed on nude clients, it is not a form of prostitution. You could start by explaining what therapeutic massage is and then what prostitution is. You could even look at the legal definition of prostitution and demonstrate to your peers that therapeutic massage does not fall into the legal definition of prostitution because it does not involve the behaviors characterized by that definition.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Factual Claims</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Factual claims</a><span class="glossdef">Persuasive claim arguing the truth or falsity of an assertion.</span></span> set out to argue the truth or falsity of an assertion. Some factual claims are simple to answer: Barack Obama is the first African American President; the tallest man in the world, Robert Wadlow, was eight feet and eleven inches tall; Facebook wasn’t profitable until 2009. All these factual claims are well documented by evidence and can be easily supported with a little research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s02_p02">However, many factual claims cannot be answered absolutely. Some factual claims are simply hard to determine the falsity or trueness of because the final answer on the subject has not been discovered (e.g., when is censorship good, what rights should animals have, when does life begin). Probably the most historically interesting and consistent factual claim is the existence of a higher power, God, or other religious deity. The simple fact of the matter is that there is not enough evidence to clearly answer this factual claim in any specific direction, which is where the notion of faith must be involved in this factual claim.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s02_p03">Other factual claims that may not be easily answered using evidence are predictions of what may or may not happen. For example, you could give a speech on the future of climate change or the future of terrorism in the United States. While there may be evidence that something will happen in the future, unless you’re a psychic, you don’t actually know what will happen in the future.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s02_p04">When thinking of factual claims, it often helps to pretend that you’re putting a specific claim on trial and as the speaker your job is to defend your claim as a lawyer would defend a client. Ultimately, your job is to be more persuasive than your audience members who act as both opposition attorneys and judges.</p>

    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Policy Claims</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03_p01">The third common claim that is seen in persuasive speeches is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">policy claim</a><span class="glossdef">Persuasive claim that describes the nature of a problem and advocates a solution.</span></span>—a statement about the nature of a problem and the solution that should be implemented. Policy claims are probably the most common form of persuasive speaking because we live in a society surrounded by problems and people who have ideas about how to fix these problems. Let’s look at a few examples of possible policy claims:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03_l01">
            <li>The United States should stop capital punishment.</li>
            <li>The United States should become independent from the use of foreign oil.</li>
            <li>Human cloning for organ donations should be legal.</li>
            <li>Nonviolent drug offenders should be sent to rehabilitation centers and not prisons.</li>
            <li>The tobacco industry should be required to pay 100 percent of the medical bills for individuals dying of smoking-related cancers.</li>
            <li>The United States needs to invest more in preventing poverty at home and less in feeding the starving around the world.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03_p02">Each of these claims has a clear perspective that is being advocated. Policy claims will always have a clear and direct opinion for what should occur and what needs to change. When examining policy claims, we generally talk about two different persuasive goals: passive agreement and immediate action.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Gain Passive Agreement</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03_s01_p01">When we attempt to gain the passive agreement of our audiences, our goal is to get our audiences to agree with what we are saying and our specific policy without asking the audience to do anything to enact the policy. For example, maybe your speech is on why the Federal Communications Commission should regulate violence on television like it does foul language (i.e., no violence until after 9 p.m.). Your goal as a speaker is to get your audience to agree that it is in our best interest as a society to prevent violence from being shown on television before 9 p.m., but you are not seeking to have your audience run out and call their senators or congressmen or even sign a petition. Often the first step in larger political change is simply getting a massive number people to agree with your policy perspective.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03_s01_p02">Let’s look at a few more passive agreement claims:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03_s01_l01">
                <li>Racial profiling of individuals suspected of belonging to known terrorist groups is a way to make America safer.</li>
                <li>Requiring American citizens to “show their papers” is a violation of democracy and resembles tactics of Nazi Germany and communist Russia.</li>
                <li>Colleges and universities should voluntarily implement a standardized testing program to ensure student learning outcomes are similar across different institutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03_s01_p03">In each of these claims, the goal is to sway one’s audience to a specific attitude, value, or belief, but not necessarily to get the audience to enact any specific behaviors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Gain Immediate Action</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03_s02_p01">The alternative to passive agreement is immediate action, or persuading your audience to start engaging in a specific behavior. Many passive agreement topics can become immediate action-oriented topics as soon as you tell your audience what behavior they should engage in (e.g., sign a petition, call a senator, vote). While it is much easier to elicit passive agreement than to get people to do something, you should always try to get your audience to act and do so quickly. A common mistake that speakers make is telling people to enact a behavior that will occur in the future. The longer it takes for people to engage in the action you desire, the less likely it is that your audience will engage in that behavior.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03_s02_p02">Here are some examples of good claims with immediate calls to action:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>College students should eat more fruit, so I am encouraging everyone to eat the apple I have provided you and start getting more fruit in your diet.</li>
                <li>Teaching a child to read is one way to ensure that the next generation will be stronger than those that have come before us, so please sign up right now to volunteer one hour a week to help teach a child to read.</li>
                <li>The United States should reduce its nuclear arsenal by 20 percent over the next five years. Please sign the letter provided encouraging the president to take this necessary step for global peace. Once you’ve signed the letter, hand it to me, and I’ll fax it to the White House today.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s03_s02_p03">Each of these three examples starts with a basic claim and then tags on an immediate call to action. Remember, the faster you can get people to engage in a behavior the more likely they actually will.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Value Claims</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s04_p01">The final type of claim is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">value claim</a><span class="glossdef">Persuasive claim advocating a judgment about something (e.g., it’s good or bad, it’s right or wrong, it’s beautiful or ugly, it’s moral or immoral).</span></span>, or a claim where the speaker is advocating a judgment claim about something (e.g., it’s good or bad, it’s right or wrong, it’s beautiful or ugly, moral or immoral).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s04_p02">Let’s look at three value claims. We’ve italicized the evaluative term in each claim:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s04_l01">
            <li>Dating people on the Internet is an <em class="emphasis">immoral</em> form of dating.</li>
            <li>SUVs are <em class="emphasis">gas guzzling monstrosities</em>.</li>
            <li>It’s <em class="emphasis">unfair</em> for pregnant women to have special parking spaces at malls, shopping centers, and stores.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s04_p03">Each of these three claims could definitely be made by a speaker and other speakers could say the exact opposite. When making a value claim, it’s hard to ascertain why someone has chosen a specific value stance without understanding her or his criteria for making the evaluative statement. For example, if someone finds all forms of technology immoral, then it’s really no surprise that he or she would find Internet dating immoral as well. As such, you need to clearly explain your criteria for making the evaluative statement. For example, when we examine the SUV claim, if your criteria for the term “gas guzzling monstrosity” are ecological impact, safety, and gas consumption, then your evaluative statement can be more easily understood and evaluated by your audience. If, however, you state that your criterion is that SUVs are bigger than military vehicles and shouldn’t be on the road, then your statement takes on a slightly different meaning. Ultimately, when making a value claim, you need to make sure that you clearly label your evaluative term and provide clear criteria for how you came to that evaluation.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="wrench_1.0-ch17_s02_s04_l02">
                <li>There are four types of persuasive claims. Definition claims argue the denotation or classification of what something is. Factual claims argue the truth or falsity about an assertion being made. Policy claims argue the nature of a problem and the solution that should be taken. Lastly, value claims argue a judgment about something (e.g., it’s good or bad, it’s right or wrong, it’s beautiful or ugly, moral or immoral).</li>
                <li>Each of the four claims leads to different types of persuasive speeches. As such, public speakers need to be aware what type of claim they are advocating in order to understand the best methods of persuasion.</li>
                <li>In policy claims, persuaders attempt to convince their audiences to either passively accept or actively act. When persuaders attempt to gain passive agreement from an audience, they hope that an audience will agree with what is said about a specific policy without asking the audience to do anything to enact the policy. Gaining immediate action, on the other hand, occurs when a persuader gets the audience to actively engage in a specific behavior.</li>
