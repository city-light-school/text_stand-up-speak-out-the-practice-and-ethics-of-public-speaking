    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_p01">When we use the word “language,” we are referring to the words you choose to use in your speech—so by definition, our focus is on spoken language. Spoken language has always existed prior to written language. Wrench, McCroskey, and Richmond suggested that if you think about the human history of language as a twelve-inch ruler, written language or recorded language has only existed for the “last quarter of an inch.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn13_006">Wrench, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p02">In today’s world, effective use of language helps us in our interpersonal relationships at home and at work. Using language effectively also will improve your ability to be an effective public speaker. Because language is an important aspect of public speaking that many students don’t spend enough time developing, we encourage you to take advantage of this chapter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p03">One of the first components necessary for understanding language is to understand how we assign meaning to words. Words consist of sounds (oral) and shapes (written) that have agreed-upon meanings based in concepts, ideas, and memories. When we write the word “blue,” we may be referring to a portion of the visual spectrum dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 440–490 nanometers. You could also say that the color in question is an equal mixture of both red and green light. While both of these are technically correct ways to interpret the word “blue,” we’re pretty sure that neither of these definitions is how you thought about the word. When hearing the word “blue,” you may have thought of your favorite color, the color of the sky on a spring day, or the color of a really ugly car you saw in the parking lot. When people think about language, there are two different types of meanings that people must be aware of: denotative and connotative.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Denotative Meaning</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Denotative meaning</a><span class="glossdef">The common agreed-upon meaning of a word that is often found in dictionaries.</span></span> is the specific meaning associated with a word. We sometimes refer to denotative meanings as dictionary definitions. The definitions provided above for the word “blue” are examples of definitions that might be found in a dictionary. The first dictionary was written by Robert Cawdry in 1604 and was called <em class="emphasis">Table Alphabeticall</em>. This dictionary of the English language consisted of three thousand commonly spoken English words. Today, the <em class="emphasis">Oxford English Dictionary</em> contains more than 200,000 words.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn13_010">Oxford University Press. (2011).

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Conotative Meaning</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Connotative meaning</a><span class="glossdef">An individual’s perception suggested by or associated with a word.</span></span> is the idea suggested by or associated with a word. In addition to the examples above, the word “blue” can evoke many other ideas:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>State of depression (feeling blue)</li>
                <li>Indication of winning (a blue ribbon)</li>
                <li>Side during the Civil War (blues vs. grays)</li>
                <li>Sudden event (out of the blue)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s02_p02">We also associate the color blue with the sky and the ocean. Maybe your school’s colors or those of your archrival include blue. There are also various forms of blue: aquamarine, baby blue, navy blue, royal blue, and so on.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s02_p03">Some miscommunication can occur over denotative meanings of words. For example, one of the authors of this book recently received a flyer for a tennis center open house. The expressed goal was to introduce children to the game of tennis. At the bottom of the flyer, people were encouraged to bring their own racquets if they had them but that “a limited number of racquets will be available.” It turned out that the denotative meaning of the final phrase was interpreted in multiple ways: some parents attending the event perceived it to mean that loaner racquets would be available for use during the open house event, but the people running the open house intended it to mean that parents could purchase racquets onsite. The confusion over denotative meaning probably hurt the tennis center, as some parents left the event feeling they had been misled by the flyer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s02_p04">Although denotatively based misunderstanding such as this one do happen, the majority of communication problems involving language occur because of differing connotative meanings. You may be trying to persuade your audience to support public funding for a new professional football stadium in your city, but if mentioning the team’s or owner’s name creates negative connotations in the minds of audience members, you will not be very persuasive. The potential for misunderstanding based in connotative meaning is an additional reason why audience analysis, discussed earlier in this book, is critically important. By conducting effective audience analysis, you can know in advance how your audience might respond to the connotations of the words and ideas you present. Connotative meanings can not only differ between individuals interacting at the same time but also differ greatly across time periods and cultures. Ultimately, speakers should attempt to have a working knowledge of how their audiences could potentially interpret words and ideas to minimize the chance of miscommunication.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Twelve Ways Oral and Written Language Differ</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s02_p01">A second important aspect to understand about language is that oral language (used in public speaking) and written language (used for texts) does not function the same way. Try a brief experiment. Take a textbook, maybe even this one, and read it out loud. When the text is read aloud, does it sound conversational? Probably not. Public speaking, on the other hand, should sound like a conversation. McCroskey, Wrench, and Richmond highlighted the following twelve differences that exist between oral and written language:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>Oral language has a smaller variety of words.</li>
            <li>Oral language has words with fewer syllables.</li>
            <li>Oral language has shorter sentences.</li>
            <li>Oral language has more self-reference words (<em class="emphasis">I</em>, <em class="emphasis">me</em>, <em class="emphasis">mine</em>).</li>
            <li>Oral language has fewer quantifying terms or precise numerical words.</li>
            <li>Oral language has more pseudoquantifying terms (<em class="emphasis">many</em>, <em class="emphasis">few</em>, <em class="emphasis">some</em>).</li>
            <li>Oral language has more extreme and superlative words (<em class="emphasis">none</em>, <em class="emphasis">all</em>, <em class="emphasis">every</em>, <em class="emphasis">always</em>, <em class="emphasis">never</em>).</li>
            <li>Oral language has more qualifying statements (clauses beginning with <em class="emphasis">unless</em> and <em class="emphasis">except</em>).</li>
            <li>Oral language has more repetition of words and syllables.</li>
            <li>Oral language uses more contractions.</li>
            <li>Oral language has more interjections (“Wow!,” “Really?,” “No!,” “You’re kidding!”).</li>
            <li>Oral language has more colloquial and nonstandard words.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn13_011">McCroskey, J. C., Wrench, J. S., &amp; Richmond, V. P. (2003). <em class="emphasis">Principles of public speaking</em>. Indianapolis, IN: The College Network.</span>
</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s02_p02">These differences exist primarily because people listen to and read information differently. First, when you read information, if you don’t grasp content the first time, you have the ability to reread a section. When we are listening to information, we do not have the ability to “rewind” life and relisten to the information. Second, when you read information, if you do not understand a concept, you can look up the concept in a dictionary or online and gain the knowledge easily. However, we do not always have the ability to walk around with the Internet and look up concepts we don’t understand. Therefore, oral communication should be simple enough to be easily understood in the moment by a specific audience, without additional study or information.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s02_l02">
                <li>Language is important in every aspect of our lives because it allows people to communicate in a manner that enables the sharing of common ideas.</li>
                <li>Denotative definitions are the agreed-upon meanings of words that are often found in dictionaries, whereas connotative definitions involve individual perceptions of words.</li>
                <li>Misunderstandings commonly occur when the source of a message intends one denotative or connotative meaning and the receiver of the message applies a different denotative or connotative meaning to the same word or words.</li>
                <li>Oral language is designed to be listened to and to sound conversational, which means that word choice must be simpler, more informal, and more repetitive. Written language uses a larger vocabulary and is more formal.</li>

                <li>Find a magazine article and examine its language choices. Which uses of language could be misunderstood as a result of a reader’s connotative application of meaning?</li>
                <li>Think of a situation in your own life where denotative or connotative meanings led to a conflict. Why do you think you and the other person had different associations of meaning?</li>
                <li>Read a short newspaper article. Take that written article and translate it into language that would be orally appropriate. What changes did you make to adjust the newspaper article from written to oral language? Orally present the revised article to a classmate or friend. Were you successful in adapting your language to oral style?</li>
