    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_p01">Once you have captured your audience’s attention, it’s important to make the rest of your introduction interesting, and use it to lay out the rest of the speech. In this section, we are going to explore the five remaining parts of an effective introduction: linking to your topic, reasons to listen, stating credibility, thesis statement, and preview.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Link to Topic</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_p01">After the attention-getter, the second major part of an introduction is called the link to topic. The link to topic is the shortest part of an introduction and occurs when a speaker demonstrates how an attention-getting device relates to the topic of a speech. Often the attention-getter and the link to topic are very clear. For example, if you look at the attention-getting device example under historical reference above, you’ll see that the first sentence brings up the history of the Vietnam War and then shows us how that war can help us understand the Iraq War. In this case, the attention-getter clearly flows directly to the topic. However, some attention-getters need further explanation to get to the topic of the speech. For example, both of the anecdote examples (the girl falling into the manhole while texting and the boy and the filberts) need further explanation to connect clearly to the speech topic (i.e., problems of multitasking in today’s society).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_p02">Let’s look at the first anecdote example to demonstrate how we could go from the attention-getter to the topic.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_p03">In July 2009, a high school girl named Alexa Longueira was walking along a main boulevard near her home on Staten Island, New York, typing in a message on her cell phone. Not paying attention to the world around her, she took a step and fell right into an open manhole. This anecdote illustrates the problem that many people are facing in today’s world. We are so wired into our technology that we forget to see what’s going on around us—like a big hole in front of us.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_p04">In this example, the third sentence here explains that the attention-getter was an anecdote that illustrates a real issue. The fourth sentence then introduces the actual topic of the speech.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_p05">Let’s now examine how we can make the transition from the parable or fable attention-getter to the topic:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_bl02">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_p06">The ancient Greek writer Aesop told a fable about a boy who put his hand into a pitcher of filberts. The boy grabbed as many of the delicious nuts as he possibly could. But when he tried to pull them out, his hand wouldn’t fit through the neck of the pitcher because he was grasping so many filberts. Instead of dropping some of them so that his hand would fit, he burst into tears and cried about his predicament. The moral of the story? “Don’t try to do too much at once.” In today’s world, many of us are us are just like the boy putting his hand into the pitcher. We are constantly trying to grab so much or do so much that it prevents us from accomplishing our goals. I would like to show you three simple techniques to manage your time so that you don’t try to pull too many filberts from your pitcher.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_p07">In this example, we added three new sentences to the attention-getter to connect it to the speech topic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Reasons to Listen</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s02_p01">Once you have linked an attention-getter to the topic of your speech, you need to explain to your audience why your topic is important. We call this the “why should I care?” part of your speech because it tells your audience why the topic is directly important to them. Sometimes you can include the significance of your topic in the same sentence as your link to the topic, but other times you may need to spell out in one or two sentences why your specific topic is important.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s02_p02">People in today’s world are very busy, and they do not like their time wasted. Nothing is worse than having to sit through a speech that has nothing to do with you. Imagine sitting through a speech about a new software package you don’t own and you will never hear of again. How would you react to the speaker? Most of us would be pretty annoyed at having had our time wasted in this way. Obviously, this particular speaker didn’t do a great job of analyzing her or his audience if the audience isn’t going to use the software package—but even when speaking on a topic that is highly relevant to the audience, speakers often totally forget to explain how and why it is important.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Appearing Credible</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_p01">The next part of a speech is not so much a specific “part” as an important characteristic that needs to be pervasive throughout your introduction and your entire speech. As a speaker, you want to be seen as credible (competent, trustworthy, and caring/having goodwill). As mentioned earlier in this chapter, credibility is ultimately a perception that is made by your audience. While your audience determines whether they perceive you as competent, trustworthy, and caring/having goodwill, there are some strategies you can employ to make yourself appear more credible.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_p02">First, to make yourself appear competent, you can either clearly explain to your audience why you are competent about a given subject or demonstrate your competence by showing that you have thoroughly researched a topic by including relevant references within your introduction. The first method of demonstrating competence—saying it directly—is only effective if you are actually a competent person on a given subject. If you are an undergraduate student and you are delivering a speech about the importance of string theory in physics, unless you are a prodigy of some kind, you are probably not a recognized expert on the subject. Conversely, if your number one hobby in life is collecting memorabilia about the Three Stooges, then you may be an expert about the Three Stooges. However, you would need to explain to your audience your passion for collecting Three Stooges memorabilia and how this has made you an expert on the topic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_p03">If, on the other hand, you are not actually a recognized expert on a topic, you need to demonstrate that you have done your homework to become more knowledgeable than your audience about your topic. The easiest way to demonstrate your competence is through the use of appropriate references from leading thinkers and researchers on your topic. When you demonstrate to your audience that you have done your homework, they are more likely to view you as competent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_p04">The second characteristic of credibility, trustworthiness, is a little more complicated than competence, for it ultimately relies on audience perceptions. One way to increase the likelihood that a speaker will be perceived as trustworthy is to use reputable sources. If you’re quoting Dr. John Smith, you need to explain who Dr. John Smith is so your audience will see the quotation as being more trustworthy. As speakers we can easily manipulate our sources into appearing more credible than they actually are, which would be unethical. When you are honest about your sources with your audience, they will trust you and your information more so than when you are ambiguous. The worst thing you can do is to out-and-out lie about information during your speech. Not only is lying highly unethical, but if you are caught lying, your audience will deem you untrustworthy and perceive everything you are saying as untrustworthy. Many speakers have attempted to lie to an audience because it will serve their own purposes or even because they believe their message is in their audience’s best interest, but lying is one of the fastest ways to turn off an audience and get them to distrust both the speaker and the message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_p05">The third characteristic of credibility to establish during the introduction is the sense of caring/goodwill. While some unethical speakers can attempt to manipulate an audience’s perception that the speaker cares, ethical speakers truly do care about their audiences and have their audience’s best interests in mind while speaking. Often speakers must speak in front of audiences that may be hostile toward the speaker’s message. In these cases, it is very important for the speaker to explain that he or she really does believe her or his message is in the audience’s best interest. One way to show that you have your audience’s best interests in mind is to acknowledge disagreement from the start:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_p06">Today I’m going to talk about why I believe we should enforce stricter immigration laws in the United States. I realize that many of you will disagree with me on this topic. I used to believe that open immigration was a necessity for the United States to survive and thrive, but after researching this topic, I’ve changed my mind. While I may not change all of your minds today, I do ask that you listen with an open mind, set your personal feelings on this topic aside, and judge my arguments on their merits.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_p07">While clearly not all audience members will be open or receptive to opening their minds and listening to your arguments, by establishing that there is known disagreement, you are telling the audience that you understand their possible views and are not trying to attack their intellect or their opinions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Thesis Statement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">thesis statement</a><span class="glossdef">A short, declarative sentence that states the purpose, intent, or main idea of a speech.</span></span> is a short, declarative sentence that states the purpose, intent, or main idea of a speech. A strong, clear thesis statement is very valuable within an introduction because it lays out the basic goal of the entire speech. We strongly believe that it is worthwhile to invest some time in framing and writing a good thesis statement. You may even want to write your thesis statement before you even begin conducting research for your speech. While you may end up rewriting your thesis statement later, having a clear idea of your purpose, intent, or main idea before you start searching for research will help you focus on the most appropriate material. To help us understand thesis statements, we will first explore their basic functions and then discuss how to write a thesis statement.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Basic Functions of a Thesis Statement</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_p01">A thesis statement helps your audience by letting them know “in a nutshell” what you are going to talk about. With a good thesis statement you will fulfill four basic functions: you express your specific purpose, provide a way to organize your main points, make your research more effective, and enhance your delivery.</p>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Express Your Specific Purpose</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s01_p01">To orient your audience, you need to be as clear as possible about your meaning. A strong thesis will prepare your audience effectively for the points that will follow. Here are two examples:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s01_l01">
                    <li>“Today, I want to discuss academic cheating.” (weak example)</li>
                    <li>“Today, I will clarify exactly what plagiarism is and give examples of its different types so that you can see how it leads to a loss of creative learning interaction.” (strong example)</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s01_p02">The weak statement will probably give the impression that you have no clear position about your topic because you haven’t said what that position is. Additionally, the term “academic cheating” can refer to many behaviors—acquiring test questions ahead of time, copying answers, changing grades, or allowing others to do your coursework—so the specific topic of the speech is still not clear to the audience.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s01_p03">The strong statement not only specifies plagiarism but also states your specific concern (loss of creative learning interaction).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s02">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Provide a Way to Organize Your Main Points</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s02_p01">A thesis statement should appear, almost verbatim, toward the end of the introduction to a speech. A thesis statement helps the audience get ready to listen to the arrangement of points that follow. Many speakers say that if they can create a strong thesis sentence, the rest of the speech tends to develop with relative ease. On the other hand, when the thesis statement is not very clear, creating a speech is an uphill battle.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s02_p02">When your thesis statement is sufficiently clear and decisive, you will know where you stand about your topic and where you intend to go with your speech. Having a clear thesis statement is especially important if you know a great deal about your topic or you have strong feelings about it. If this is the case for you, you need to know exactly what you are planning on talking about in order to fit within specified time limitations. Knowing where you are and where you are going is the entire point in establishing a thesis statement; it makes your speech much easier to prepare and to present.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s02_p03">Let’s say you have a fairly strong thesis statement, and that you’ve already brainstormed a list of information that you know about the topic. Chances are your list is too long and has no focus. Using your thesis statement, you can select only the information that (1) is directly related to the thesis and (2) can be arranged in a sequence that will make sense to the audience and will support the thesis. In essence, a strong thesis statement helps you keep useful information and weed out less useful information.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s03">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Make Your Research More Effective</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s03_p01">If you begin your research with only a general topic in mind, you run the risk of spending hours reading mountains of excellent literature about your topic. However, mountains of literature do not always make coherent speeches. You may have little or no idea of how to tie your research all together, or even whether you should tie it together. If, on the other hand, you conduct your research with a clear thesis statement in mind, you will be better able to zero in only on material that directly relates to your chosen thesis statement. Let’s look at an example that illustrates this point:</p>
                <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s03_bl01">
                    <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s03_p02">Many traffic accidents involve drivers older than fifty-five.</p>
                </span>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s03_p03">While this statement may be true, you could find industrial, medical, insurance literature that can drone on <em class="emphasis">ad infinitum</em> about the details of all such accidents in just one year. Instead, focusing your thesis statement will help you narrow the scope of information you will be searching for while gathering information. Here’s an example of a more focused thesis statement:</p>
                <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s03_bl02">
                    <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s03_p04">Three factors contribute to most accidents involving drivers over fifty-five years of age: failing eyesight, slower reflexes, and rapidly changing traffic conditions.</p>
                </span>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s03_p05">This framing is somewhat better. This thesis statement at least provides three possible main points and some keywords for your electronic catalog search. However, if you want your audience to understand the context of older people at the wheel, consider something like:</p>
                <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s03_bl03">
                    <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s03_p06">Mature drivers over fifty-five years of age must cope with more challenging driving conditions than existed only one generation ago: more traffic moving at higher speeds, the increased imperative for quick driving decisions, and rapidly changing ramp and cloverleaf systems. Because of these challenges, I want my audience to believe that drivers over the age of sixty-five should be required to pass a driving test every five years.</p>
                </span>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s03_p07">This framing of the thesis provides some interesting choices. First, several terms need to be defined, and these definitions might function surprisingly well in setting the tone of the speech. Your definitions of words like “generation,” “quick driving decisions,” and “cloverleaf systems” could jolt your audience out of assumptions they have taken for granted as truth.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s03_p08">Second, the framing of the thesis provides you with a way to describe the specific changes as they have occurred between, say, 1970 and 2010. How much, and in what ways, have the volume and speed of traffic changed? Why are quick decisions more critical now? What is a “cloverleaf,” and how does any driver deal cognitively with exiting in the direction seemingly opposite to the desired one? Questions like this, suggested by your own thesis statement, can lead to a strong, memorable speech.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s04">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Enhance Your Delivery</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s01_s04_p01">When your thesis is not clear to you, your listeners will be even more clueless than you are—but if you have a good clear thesis statement, your speech becomes clear to your listeners. When you stand in front of your audience presenting your introduction, you can vocally emphasize the essence of your speech, expressed as your thesis statement. Many speakers pause for a half second, lower their vocal pitch slightly, slow down a little, and deliberately present the thesis statement, the one sentence that encapsulates its purpose. When this is done effectively, the purpose, intent, or main idea of a speech is driven home for an audience.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">How to Write a Thesis Statement</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s02_p01">Now that we’ve looked at why a thesis statement is crucial in a speech, let’s switch gears and talk about how we go about writing a solid thesis statement. A thesis statement is related to the general and specific purposes of a speech as we discussed them in <a class="xref" href="wrench_1.0-ch06#wrench_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "Finding a Purpose and Selecting a Topic"</a>.</p>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s02_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Choose Your Topic</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s02_s01_p01">The first step in writing a good thesis statement was originally discussed in <a class="xref" href="wrench_1.0-ch06#wrench_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "Finding a Purpose and Selecting a Topic"</a> when we discussed how to find topics. Once you have a general topic, you are ready to go to the second step of creating a thesis statement.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s02_s02">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Narrow Your Topic</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s02_s02_p01">One of the hardest parts of writing a thesis statement is narrowing a speech from a broad topic to one that can be easily covered during a five- to ten-minute speech. While five to ten minutes may sound like a long time to new public speakers, the time flies by very quickly when you are speaking. You can easily run out of time if your topic is too broad. To ascertain if your topic is narrow enough for a specific time frame, ask yourself three questions.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s02_s02_p02">First, is your thesis statement narrow or is it a broad overgeneralization of a topic? An overgeneralization occurs when we classify everyone in a specific group as having a specific characteristic. For example, a speaker’s thesis statement that “all members of the National Council of La Raza are militant” is an overgeneralization of all members of the organization. Furthermore, a speaker would have to correctly demonstrate that all members of the organization are militant for the thesis statement to be proven, which is a very difficult task since the National Council of La Raza consists of millions of Hispanic Americans. A more appropriate thesis related to this topic could be, “Since the creation of the National Council of La Raza [NCLR] in 1968, the NCLR has become increasingly militant in addressing the causes of Hispanics in the United States.”</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s02_s02_p03">The second question to ask yourself when narrowing a topic is whether your speech’s topic is one clear topic or multiple topics. A strong thesis statement consists of only a single topic. The following is an example of a thesis statement that contains too many topics: “Medical marijuana, prostitution, and gay marriage should all be legalized in the United States.” Not only are all three fairly broad, but you also have three completely unrelated topics thrown into a single thesis statement. Instead of a thesis statement that has multiple topics, limit yourself to only one topic. Here’s an example of a thesis statement examining only one topic: “Today we’re going to examine the legalization and regulation of the oldest profession in the state of Nevada.” In this case, we’re focusing our topic to how one state has handled the legalization and regulation of prostitution.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s02_s02_p04">The last question a speaker should ask when making sure a topic is sufficiently narrow is whether the topic has direction. If your basic topic is too broad, you will never have a solid thesis statement or a coherent speech. For example, if you start off with the topic “Barack Obama is a role model for everyone,” what do you mean by this statement? Do you think President Obama is a role model because of his dedication to civic service? Do you think he’s a role model because he’s a good basketball player? Do you think he’s a good role model because he’s an excellent public speaker? When your topic is too broad, almost anything can become part of the topic. This ultimately leads to a lack of direction and coherence within the speech itself. To make a cleaner topic, a speaker needs to narrow her or his topic to one specific area. For example, you may want to examine why President Obama is a good speaker.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s02_s03_p01">Once you’ve narrowed your topic to something that is reasonably manageable given the constraints placed on your speech, you can then formalize that topic as a complete sentence. For example, you could turn the topic of President Obama’s public speaking skills into the following sentence: “Because of his unique sense of lyricism and his well-developed presentational skills, President Barack Obama is a modern symbol of the power of public speaking.” Once you have a clear topic sentence, you can start tweaking the thesis statement to help set up the purpose of your speech.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Add Your Argument, Viewpoint, or Opinion</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s02_s04_p01">This function only applies if you are giving a speech to persuade. If your topic is informative, your job is to make sure that the thesis statement is nonargumentative and focuses on facts. For example, in the preceding thesis statement we have a couple of opinion-oriented terms that should be avoided for informative speeches: “unique sense,” “well-developed,” and “power.” All three of these terms are laced with an individual’s opinion, which is fine for a persuasive speech but not for an informative speech. For informative speeches, the goal of a thesis statement is to explain what the speech will be informing the audience about, not attempting to add the speaker’s opinion about the speech’s topic. For an informative speech, you could rewrite the thesis statement to read, “This speech is going to analyze Barack Obama’s use of lyricism in his speech, ‘A World That Stands as One,’ delivered July 2008 in Berlin.”</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s02_s04_p02">On the other hand, if your topic is persuasive, you want to make sure that your argument, viewpoint, or opinion is clearly indicated within the thesis statement. If you are going to argue that Barack Obama is a great speaker, then you should set up this argument within your thesis statement.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s02_s05_p01">Once you have written a first draft of your thesis statement, you’re probably going to end up revising your thesis statement a number of times prior to delivering your actual speech. A thesis statement is something that is constantly tweaked until the speech is given. As your speech develops, often your thesis will need to be rewritten to whatever direction the speech itself has taken. We often start with a speech going in one direction, and find out through our research that we should have gone in a different direction. When you think you finally have a thesis statement that is good to go for your speech, take a second and make sure it adheres to the criteria shown in <a class="xref" href="#wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_s02_s05_t01">Table 9.1 "Thesis Checklist"</a></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Preview of Speech</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch09_s03_s05_p01">The final part of an introduction contains a preview of the major points to be covered within your speech. I’m sure we’ve all seen signs that have three cities listed on them with the mileage to reach each city. This mileage sign is an indication of what is to come. A preview works the same way. A preview foreshadows what the main body points will be in the speech. For example, to preview a speech on bullying in the workplace, one could say, “To understand the nature of bullying in the modern workplace, I will first define what workplace bullying is and the types of bullying, I will then discuss the common characteristics of both workplace bullies and their targets, and lastly, I will explore some possible solutions to workplace bullying.” In this case, each of the phrases mentioned in the preview would be a single distinct point made in the speech itself. In other words, the first major body point in this speech would examine what workplace bullying is and the types of bullying; the second major body point in this speech would discuss the common characteristics of both workplace bullies and their targets; and lastly, the third body point in this speech would explore some possible solutions to workplace bullying.</p>
