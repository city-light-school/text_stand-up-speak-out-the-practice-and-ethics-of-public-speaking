    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_p01">Now that we have described what audience analysis is and why it is important, let’s examine some details of how to conduct it. Exactly how can you learn about the people who will make up your audience?</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Direct Observation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_p01">One way to learn about people is to observe them. By observing nonverbal patterns of behavior, you can learn a great deal as long as you are careful how you interpret the behaviors. For instance, do people greet each other with a handshake, a hug, a smile, or a nod? Do members of opposite sexes make physical contact? Does the setting suggest more conservative behavior? By listening in on conversations, you can find out the issues that concern people. Are people in the campus center talking about political unrest in the Middle East? About concerns over future Pell Grant funding? We suggest that you consider the ethical dimensions of eavesdropping, however. Are you simply overhearing an open conversation, or are you prying into a highly personal or private discussion?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Interviews and Surveys</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p01">Because your demographic analysis will be limited to your most likely audience, your most accurate way to learn about them is to seek personal information through interviews and surveys. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interview</a><span class="glossdef">A one-on-one exchange in which you ask questions of a respondent.</span></span> is a one-on-one exchange in which you ask questions of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">respondent</a><span class="glossdef">Someone who responds to a survey, questionnaire, interview, or focus group.</span></span>, whereas a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">survey</a><span class="glossdef">A set of written questions with multiple-choice questions and/or open-ended questions.</span></span> is a set of questions administered to several—or, preferably, many—respondents. Interviews may be conducted face-to-face, by phone, or by written means, such as texting. They allow more in-depth discussion than surveys, and they are also more time consuming to conduct. Surveys are also sometimes conducted face-to-face or by phone, but online surveys are increasingly common. You may collect and tabulate survey results manually, or set up an automated online survey through the free or subscription portals of sites like Survey Monkey and Zoomerang. Using an online survey provides the advantage of keeping responses anonymous, which may increase your audience members’ willingness to participate and to answer personal questions. Surveys are an efficient way to collect information quickly; however, in contrast to interviews, they don’t allow for follow-up questions to help you understand why your respondent gave a certain answer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p02">When you use interviews and surveys, there are several important things to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>Make sure your interview and survey questions are directly related to your speech topic. Do not use interviews to delve into private areas of people’s lives. For instance, if your speech is about the debate between creationism and evolution, limit your questions to their opinions about that topic; do not meander into their beliefs about sexual behavior or their personal religious practices.</li>
            <li>Create and use a standard set of questions. If you “ad lib” your questions so that they are phrased differently for different interviewees, you will be comparing “apples and oranges” when you compare the responses you’ve obtained.</li>
            <li>Keep interviews and surveys short, or you could alienate your audience long before your speech is even outlined. Tell them the purpose of the interview or survey and make sure they understand that their participation is voluntary.</li>
            <li>Don’t rely on just a few respondents to inform you about your entire audience. In all likelihood, you have a cognitively diverse audience. In order to accurately identify trends, you will likely need to interview or survey at least ten to twenty people.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p03">In addition, when you conduct interviews and surveys, keep in mind that people are sometimes less than honest in describing their beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. This widely recognized weakness of interviews and survey research is known as <em class="emphasis">socially desirable responding</em>: the tendency to give responses that are considered socially acceptable. Marketing professor Ashok Lalwani divides socially desirable responding into two types: (1) impression management, or intentionally portraying oneself in a favorable light and (2) self-deceptive enhancement, or exaggerating one’s good qualities, often unconsciously.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_010">Lalwani, A. K. (2009, August). The distinct influence of cognitive busyness and need for closure on cultural differences in socially desirable responding. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Consumer Research</em>, <em class="emphasis">36</em>, 305–316. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://business.utsa.edu/marketing/files/phdpapers/lalwani2_2009-jcr.pdf">http://business.utsa.edu/marketing/files/phdpapers/lalwani2_2009-jcr.pdf</a></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p04">You can reduce the effects of socially desirable responding by choosing your questions carefully. As marketing consultant Terry Vavra advises, “one should never ask what one can’t logically expect respondents to honestly reveal.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_011">Vavra, T. G. (2009, June 14). The truth about truth in survey research. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.terryvavra.com/customer-research/the-truth-about-truth-in-survey-research">http://www.terryvavra.com/customer-research/the-truth-about-truth-in-survey-research</a></span> For example, if you want to know audience members’ attitudes about body piercing, you are likely to get more honest answers by asking “Do you think body piercing is attractive?” rather than “How many piercings do you have and where on your body are they located?”</p>

    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Focus Groups</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">focus group</a><span class="glossdef">A group of three to eight people who meet together to respond to questions asked by the researcher. A focus group is usually an anonymous group and their responses can be freewheeling. With permission, their discussion can be recorded.</span></span> is a small group of people who give you feedback about their perceptions. As with interviews and surveys, in a focus group you should use a limited list of carefully prepared questions designed to get at the information you need to understand their beliefs, attitudes, and values specifically related to your topic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_p02">If you conduct a focus group, part of your task will be striking a balance between allowing the discussion to flow freely according to what group members have to say and keeping the group focused on the questions. It’s also your job to guide the group in maintaining responsible and respectful behavior toward each other.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_p03">In evaluating focus group feedback, do your best to be receptive to what people had to say, whether or not it conforms to what you expected. Your purpose in conducting the group was to understand group members’ beliefs, attitudes, and values about your topic, not to confirm your assumptions.</p>

    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Existing Data about Your Audience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_p01">Occasionally, existing information will be available about your audience. For instance, if you have a student audience, it might not be difficult to find out what their academic majors are. You might also be able to find out their degree of investment in their educations; for instance, you could reasonably assume that the seniors in the audience have been successful students who have invested at least three years pursuing a higher education. Sophomores have at least survived their first year but may not have matched the seniors in demonstrating strong values toward education and the work ethic necessary to earn a degree.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_p02">In another kind of an audience, you might be able to learn other significant facts. For instance, are they veterans? Are they retired teachers? Are they members of a voluntary civic organization such as the Lions Club or Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD)? This kind of information should help you respond to their concerns and interests.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_p03">In other cases, you may be able to use demographics collected by public and private organizations. Demographic analysis is done by the US Census Bureau through the American Community Survey, which is conducted every year, and through other specialized demographic surveys.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn05_012">Bureau of the Census. (2011). About the American community survey. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/about_the_survey/american_community_survey/">http://www.census.gov/acs/www/about_the_survey/american_community_survey/</a>; Bureau of the Census.

Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.census.gov/aboutus/sur_demo.html">http://www.census.gov/aboutus/sur_demo.html</a></span> The Census Bureau analysis generally captures information about people in all the regions of the United States, but you can drill down in census data to see results by state, by age group, by gender, by race, and by other factors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_p04">Demographic information about narrower segments of the United States, down to the level of individual zip codes, is available through private organizations such as The Nielsen Company (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.claritas.com/MyBestSegments/Default.jsp?ID=20&amp;SubID=&amp;pageName=ZIP%2BCode%2BLook-up">http://www.claritas.com/MyBestSegments/Default.jsp?ID=20&amp;SubID=&amp;pageName=ZIP%2BCode%2BLook-up</a>), Sperling’s Best Places (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bestplaces.net">http://www.bestplaces.net</a>), and Point2Homes (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://homes.point2.com">http://homes.point2.com</a>). Sales and marketing professionals use this data, and you may find it useful for your audience analysis as well.</p>

                <li>Write a coherent set of four clear questions about a given issue, such as campus library services, campus computer centers, or the process of course registration. Make your questions concrete and specific in order to address the information you seek. Do not allow opportunities for your respondent to change the subject. Test out your questions on a classmate.</li>
                <li>Write a set of six questions about public speaking anxiety to be answered on a Likert-type scale (strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, and strongly disagree).</li>
                <li>Create a seven-question set designed to discover your audience’s attitudes about your speech topic. Have a partner evaluate your questions for clarity, respect for audience privacy, and relevance to your topic.</li>
