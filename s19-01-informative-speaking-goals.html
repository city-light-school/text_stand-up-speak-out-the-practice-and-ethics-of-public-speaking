<span class="title-prefix">16.1</span> Informative Speaking Goals</h2>
    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_l01">
            <li>Explain the importance of accuracy, clarity, and listener interest in informative speaking.</li>
            <li>Discuss why speaking to inform is important. Identify strategies for making information clear and interesting to your speaking audience.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_p01">A good informative speech conveys accurate information to the audience in a way that is clear and that keeps the listener interested in the topic. Achieving all three of these goals—accuracy, clarity, and interest—is the key to your effectiveness as a speaker. If information is inaccurate, incomplete, or unclear, it will be of limited usefulness to the audience. There is no topic about which you can give complete information, and therefore, we strongly recommend careful narrowing. With a carefully narrowed topic and purpose, it is possible to give an accurate picture that isn’t misleading.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_p02">Part of being accurate is making sure that your information is current. Even if you know a great deal about your topic or wrote a good paper on the topic in a high school course, you need to verify the accuracy and completeness of what you know. Most people understand that technology changes rapidly, so you need to update your information almost constantly, but the same is true for topics that, on the surface, may seem to require less updating. For example, the American Civil War occurred 150 years ago, but contemporary research still offers new and emerging theories about the causes of the war and its long-term effects. So even with a topic that seems to be unchanging, you need to carefully check your information to be sure it’s accurate and up to date.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_p03">In order for your listeners to benefit from your speech, you must convey your ideas in a fashion that your audience can understand. The clarity of your speech relies on logical organization and understandable word choices. You should not assume that something that’s obvious to you will also be obvious to the members of your audience. Formulate your work with the objective of being understood in all details, and rehearse your speech in front of peers who will tell you whether the information in your speech makes sense.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_p04">In addition to being clear, your speech should be interesting. Your listeners will benefit the most if they can give sustained attention to the speech, and this is unlikely to happen if they are bored. This often means you will decide against using some of the topics you know a great deal about. Suppose, for example, that you had a summer job as a veterinary assistant and learned a great deal about canine parasites. This topic might be very interesting to you, but how interesting will it be to others in your class? In order to make it interesting, you will need to find a way to connect it with their interests and curiosities. Perhaps there are certain canine parasites that also pose risks to humans—this might be a connection that would increase audience interest in your topic.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why We Speak to Inform</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s01_p01">Informative speaking is a means for the delivery of knowledge. In informative speaking, we avoid expressing opinion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s01_p02">This doesn’t mean you may not speak about controversial topics. However, if you do so, you must deliver a fair statement of each side of the issue in debate. If your speech is about standardized educational testing, you must honestly represent the views both of its proponents and of its critics. You must not take sides, and you must not slant your explanation of the debate in order to influence the opinions of the listeners. You are simply and clearly defining the debate. If you watch the evening news on a major network television (ABC, CBS, or NBC), you will see newscasters who undoubtedly have personal opinions about the news, but are trained to avoid expressing those opinions through the use of loaded words, gestures, facial expressions, or vocal tone. Like those newscasters, you are already educating your listeners simply by informing them. Let them make up their own minds. This is probably the most important reason for informative speaking.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Making Information Clear and Interesting for the Audience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_p01">A clear and interesting speech can make use of description, causal analysis, or categories. With description, you use words to create a picture in the minds of your audience. You can describe physical realities, social realities, emotional experiences, sequences, consequences, or contexts. For instance, you can describe the mindset of the Massachusetts town of Salem during the witch trials. You can also use causal analysis, which focuses on the connections between causes and consequences. For example, in speaking about health care costs, you could explain how a serious illness can put even a well-insured family into bankruptcy. You can also use categories to group things together. For instance, you could say that there are three categories of investment for the future: liquid savings, avoiding debt, and acquiring properties that will increase in value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_p02">There are a number of principles to keep in mind as a speaker to make the information you present clear and interesting for your audience. Let’s examine several of them.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Adjust Complexity to the Audience</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s01_p01">If your speech is too complex or too simplistic, it will not hold the interest of your listeners. How can you determine the right level of complexity? Your audience analysis is one important way to do this. Will your listeners belong to a given age group, or are they more diverse? Did they all go to public schools in the United States, or are some of your listeners international students? Are they all students majoring in communication studies, or is there a mixture of majors in your audience? The answers to these and other audience analysis questions will help you to gauge what they know and what they are curious about.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s01_p02">Never assume that just because your audience is made up of students, they all share your knowledge set. If you base your speech on an assumption of similar knowledge, you might not make sense to everyone. If, for instance, you’re an intercultural communication student discussing <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">multiple identities</a><span class="glossdef">In communication studies, the idea that everyone has identities connected to family, religion, occupation, cultural origin, gender, and other characteristics.</span></span>, the psychology students in your audience will most likely reject your message. Similarly, the term “viral” has very different meanings depending on whether it is used with respect to human disease, popular response to a website, or population theory. In using the word “viral,” you absolutely must explain specifically what you mean. You should not hurry your explanation of a term that’s vulnerable to misinterpretation. Make certain your listeners know what you mean before continuing your speech. Stephen Lucas explains, “You cannot assume they will know what you mean. Rather, you must be sure to explain everything so thoroughly that they cannot help but understand.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn16_001">Lucas, Stephen E. (2004). <em class="emphasis">The art of public speaking</em>. Boston: McGraw-Hill.</span> Define terms to help listeners understand them the way you mean them to. Give explanations that are consistent with your definitions, and show how those ideas apply to your speech topic. In this way, you can avoid many misunderstandings.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s01_p03">Similarly, be very careful about assuming there is anything that “everybody knows.” Suppose you’ve decided to present an informative speech on the survival of the early colonists of New England. You may have learned in elementary school that their survival was attributable, in part, to the assistance of Squanto. Many of your listeners will know which states are in New England, but if there are international students in the audience, they might never have heard of New England. You should clarify the term either by pointing out the region on a map or by stating that it’s the six states in the American northeast. Other knowledge gaps can still confound the effectiveness of the speech. For instance, who or what was Squanto? What kind of assistance did the settlers get? Only a few listeners are likely to know that Squanto spoke English and that fact had greatly surprised the settlers when they landed. It was through his knowledge of English that Squanto was able to advise these settlers in survival strategies during that first harsh winter. If you neglect to provide that information, your speech will not be fully informative.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s01_p04">Beyond the opportunity to help improve your delivery, one important outcome of practicing your speech in front of a live audience of a couple of friends or classmates is that you can become aware of terms that are confusing or that you should define for your audience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Avoid Unnecessary Jargon</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s02_p01">If you decide to give an informative speech on a highly specialized topic, limit how much technical language or jargon you use. Loading a speech with specialized language has the potential to be taxing on the listeners. It can become too difficult to “translate” your meanings, and if that happens, you will not effectively deliver information. Even if you define many technical terms, the audience may feel as if they are being bombarded with a set of definitions instead of useful information. Don’t treat your speech as a crash course in an entire topic. If you must, introduce one specialized term and carefully define and explain it to the audience. Define it in words, and then use a concrete and relevant example to clarify the meaning.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s02_p02">Some topics, by their very nature, are too technical for a short speech. For example, in a five-minute speech you would be foolish to try to inform your audience about the causes of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear emergency that occurred in Japan in 2011. Other topics, while technical, can be presented in audience-friendly ways that minimize the use of technical terms. For instance, in a speech about Mount Vesuvius, the volcano that buried the ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, you can use the term “pyroclastic flow” as long as you take the time to either show or tell what it means.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Create Concrete Images</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s03_p01">As a college student, you have had a significant amount of exposure to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">abstract</a><span class="glossdef">A term that is imprecise, leaving the meaning open to interpretation.</span></span> terms. You have become comfortable using and hearing a variety of abstract ideas. However, abstract terms lend themselves to many interpretations. For instance, the abstract term “responsibility” can mean many things. Among other meanings, it can mean duty, task, authority, or blame. Because of the potential for misunderstanding, it is better to use a <em class="emphasis">concrete</em> word. For example, instead of saying, “Helen Worth was responsible for the project,” you will convey clearer meaning when you say, “Helen Worth was in charge of the project,” “Helen Kimes made the project a success,” or “Helen Worth was to blame for the failure of the project.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s03_p02">To illustrate the differences between abstract and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">concrete</a><span class="glossdef">A term that directly names a specific thing. Its meaning is unlikely to require any interpretation.</span></span> language, let’s look at a few pairs of terms:</p>
            <div class="informaltable block" frame="all">
                <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th><strong class="emphasis bold">Abstract</strong></th>
                            <th><strong class="emphasis bold">Concrete</strong></th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>transportation</td>
                            <td>air travel</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>success</td>
                            <td>completion of project</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>discrimination</td>
                            <td>exclusion of women</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>athletic</td>
                            <td>physically fit</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>profound</td>
                            <td>knowledgeable</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s03_p03">By using an abstraction in a sentence and then comparing the concrete term in the sentence, you will notice the more precise meanings of the concrete terms. Those precise terms are less likely to be misunderstood. In the last pair of terms, “knowledgeable” is listed as a concrete term, but it can also be considered an abstract term. Still, it’s likely to be much clearer and more precise than “profound.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Keep Information Limited</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s04_p01">When you developed your speech, you carefully narrowed your topic in order to keep information limited yet complete and coherent. If you carefully adhere to your own narrowing, you can keep from going off on tangents or confusing your audience. If you overload your audience with information, they will be unable to follow your narrative. Use the definitions, descriptions, explanations, and examples you need in order to make your meanings clear, but resist the temptation to add <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tangential</a><span class="glossdef">Information that is somewhat related to the topic and thesis but is, nonetheless, a digression.</span></span> information merely because you find it interesting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Link Current Knowledge to New Knowledge</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s05_p01">Certain sets of knowledge are common to many people in your classroom audience. For instance, most of them know what Wikipedia is. Many have found it a useful and convenient source of information about topics related to their coursework. Because many Wikipedia entries are lengthy, greatly annotated, and followed by substantial lists of authoritative sources, many students have relied on information acquired from Wikipedia in writing papers to fulfill course requirements. All this is information that virtually every classroom listener is likely to know. This is the current knowledge of your audience.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s05_p02">Because your listeners are already familiar with Wikipedia, you can link important new knowledge to their already-existing knowledge. Wikipedia is an “open source,” meaning that anyone can supplement, edit, correct, distort, or otherwise alter the information in Wikipedia. In addition to your listeners’ knowledge that a great deal of good information can be found in Wikipedia, they must now know that it isn’t authoritative. Some of your listeners may not enjoy hearing this message, so you must find a way to make it acceptable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s05_p03">One way to make the message acceptable to your listeners is to show what Wikipedia does well. For example, some Wikipedia entries contain many good references at the end. Most of those references are likely to be authoritative, having been written by scholars. In searching for information on a topic, a student can look up one or more of those references in full-text databases or in the library. In this way, Wikipedia can be helpful in steering a student toward the authoritative information they need. Explaining this to your audience will help them accept, rather than reject, the bad news about Wikipedia.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s06">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Make It Memorable</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s06_p01">If you’ve already done the preliminary work in choosing a topic, finding an interesting narrowing of that topic, developing and using presentation aids, and working to maintain audience contact, your delivery is likely to be memorable. Now you can turn to your content and find opportunities to make it appropriately vivid. You can do this by using explanations, comparisons, examples, or language.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s06_p02">Let’s say that you’re preparing a speech on the United States’ internment of Japanese American people from the San Francisco Bay area during World War II. Your goal is to paint a memorable image in your listeners’ minds. You can do this through a dramatic contrast, before and after. You could say, “In 1941, the Bay area had a vibrant and productive community of Japanese American citizens who went to work every day, opening their shops, typing reports in their offices, and teaching in their classrooms, just as they had been doing for years. But on December 7, 1941, everything changed. Within six months, Bay area residents of Japanese ancestry were gone, transported to internment camps located hundreds of miles from the Pacific coast.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s06_p03">This strategy rests on the ability of the audience to visualize the two contrasting situations. You have alluded to two sets of images that are familiar to most college students, images that they can easily visualize. Once the audience imagination is engaged in visualization, they are likely to remember the speech.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s06_p04">Your task of providing memorable imagery does not stop after the introduction. While maintaining an even-handed approach that does not seek to persuade, you must provide the audience with information about the circumstances that triggered the policy of internment, perhaps by describing the advice that was given to President Roosevelt by his top advisers. You might depict the conditions faced by Japanese Americans during their internment by describing a typical day one of the camps. To conclude your speech on a memorable note, you might name a notable individual—an actor, writer, or politician—who is a survivor of the internment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s06_p05">Such a strategy might feel unnatural to you. After all, this is not how you talk to your friends or participate in a classroom discussion. Remember, though, that public speaking is not the same as talking. It’s prepared and formal. It demands more of you. In a conversation, it might not be important to be memorable; your goal might merely be to maintain friendship. But in a speech, when you expect the audience to pay attention, you must make the speech memorable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s07">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Make It Relevant and Useful</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s07_p01">When thinking about your topic, it is always very important to keep your audience members center stage in your mind. For instance, if your speech is about air pollution, ask your audience to imagine feeling the burning of eyes and lungs caused by smog. This is a strategy for making the topic more real to them, since it may have happened to them on a number of occasions; and even if it hasn’t, it easily could. If your speech is about Mark Twain, instead of simply saying that he was very famous during his lifetime, remind your audience that he was so prominent that their own great-grandparents likely knew of his work and had strong opinions about it. In so doing, you’ve connected your topic to their own forebears.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s08">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Personalize Your Content</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s08_p01">Giving a human face to a topic helps the audience perceive it as interesting. If your topic is related to the Maasai rite of passage into manhood, the prevalence of drug addiction in a particular locale, the development of a professional filmmaker, or the treatment of a disease, putting a human face should not be difficult. To do it, find a case study you can describe within the speech, referring to the human subject by name. This conveys to the audience that these processes happen to real people.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_s08_p02">Make sure you use a real case study, though—don’t make one up. Using a fictional character without letting your audience know that the example is hypothetical is a betrayal of the listener’s trust, and hence, is unethical.</p>
