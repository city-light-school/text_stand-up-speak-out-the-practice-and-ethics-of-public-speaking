    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s03_p01">At times, everyone has difficulty staying completely focused during a lengthy presentation. We can sometimes have difficulty listening to even relatively brief messages. Some of the factors that interfere with good listening might exist beyond our control, but others are manageable. It’s helpful to be aware of these factors so that they interfere as little as possible with understanding the message.</p>

There are many kinds of noise, but we will focus on only the four you are most likely to encounter in public speaking situations: physical noise, psychological noise, physiological noise, and semantic noise.</p>

Construction noises right outside a window, planes flying directly overhead, or loud music in the next room can make it difficult to hear the message being presented by a speaker even if a microphone is being used. It is sometimes possible to manage the context to reduce the noise. Closing a window might be helpful. Asking the people in the next room to turn their music down might be possible. Changing to a new location is more difficult, as it involves finding a new location and having everyone get there.</p>

For example, if you are preoccupied with personal problems, it is difficult to give your full attention to understanding the meanings of a message. The presence of another person to whom you feel attracted, or perhaps a person you dislike intensely, can also be psychosocial noise that draws your attention away from the message.</p>

Maybe you’re listening to a speech in class around noon and you haven’t eaten anything. Your stomach may be growling and your desk is starting to look tasty.

In either case, your body can distract you from attending to the information being presented.</p>

While you are attempting to understand a particular word or phrase, the speaker continues to present the message. While you are struggling with a word interpretation, you are distracted from listening to the rest of the message. One of the authors was listening to a speaker who mentioned using a sweeper to clean carpeting. The author was confused, as she did not see how a broom would be effective in cleaning carpeting. Later, the author found out that the speaker was using the word “sweeper” to refer to a vacuum cleaner; however, in the meantime, her listening was hurt by her inability to understand what the speaker meant. Another example of semantic noise is euphemism. Euphemism is diplomatic language used for delivering unpleasant information. For instance, if someone is said to be “flexible with the truth,” it might take us a moment to understand that the speaker means this person sometimes lies.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Attention Span</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p01">A person can only maintain focused attention for a finite length of time. In his 1985 book <em class="emphasis">Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business</em>, New York University’s Steinhardt School of Education professor Neil Postman argued that modern audiences have lost the ability to sustain attention to a message.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn04_004">Postman, N. (1985). <em class="emphasis">Amusing ourselves to death: Public discourse in the age of show business</em>. New York: Viking Press.</span> More recently, researchers have engaged in an ongoing debate over whether Internet use is detrimental to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">attention span</a><span class="glossdef">The length of time a listener can maintain focused attention to a message.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn04_005">Carr, N.

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p02">The limits of the human attention span can interfere with listening, but listeners and speakers can use strategies to prevent this interference. As many classroom instructors know, listeners will readily renew their attention when the presentation includes frequent breaks in pacing.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn04_006">Middendorf, J., &amp; Kalish, A. (1996). The “change-up” in lectures. <em class="emphasis">The National Teaching and Learning Forum</em>, <em class="emphasis">5</em>(2).</span> For example, a fifty- to seventy-five-minute class session might include some lecture material alternated with questions for class discussion, video clips, handouts, and demonstrations. Instructors who are adept at holding listeners’ attention also move about the front of the room, writing on the board, drawing diagrams, and intermittently using slide transparencies or PowerPoint slides.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p03">If you have instructors who do a good job of keeping your attention, they are positive role models showing strategies you can use to accommodate the limitations of your audience’s attention span.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Receiver Biases</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_p01">Good listening involves keeping an open mind and withholding judgment until the speaker has completed the message. Conversely, biased listening is characterized by jumping to conclusions; the biased listener believes, “I don’t need to listen because I already know what I think.” <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Receiver biases</a><span class="glossdef">Preconceived ideas that interfere with accurately understanding and remembering a message. These biases can refer either to the speaker or to the topic.</span></span> can refer to two things: biases with reference to the speaker and preconceived ideas and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">opinions</a><span class="glossdef">Opinions are beliefs we have about the worth of things we know or believe we know.</span></span> about the topic or message. Both can be considered noise. Everyone has biases, but good listeners have learned to hold them in check while listening.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_p02">The first type of bias listeners can have is related to the speaker. Often a speaker stands up and an audience member simply doesn’t like the speaker, so the audience member may not listen to the speaker’s message. Maybe you have a classmate who just gets under your skin for some reason, or maybe you question a classmate’s competence on a given topic. When we have preconceived notions about a speaker, those biases can interfere with our ability to listen accurately and competently to the speaker’s message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_p03">The second type of bias listeners can have is related to the topic or content of the speech. Maybe the speech topic is one you’ve heard a thousand times, so you just tune out the speech. Or maybe the speaker is presenting a topic or position you fundamentally disagree with. When listeners have strong preexisting opinions about a topic, such as the death penalty, religious issues, affirmative action, abortion, or global warming, their biases may make it difficult for them to even consider new information about the topic, especially if the new information is inconsistent with what they already believe to be true. As listeners, we have difficulty identifying our biases, especially when they seem to make sense. However, it is worth recognizing that our lives would be very difficult if no one ever considered new points of view or new information. We live in a world where everyone can benefit from clear thinking and open-minded listening.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Listening or Receiver Apprehension</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s03_s04_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Listening or receiver apprehension</a><span class="glossdef">The listener’s anxiety about his or her ability to understand the information, concepts, or vocabulary in a message.</span></span> is the fear that you might be unable to understand the message or process the information correctly or be able to adapt your thinking to include the new information coherently.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn04_007">Wheeless, L. R. (1975). An investigation of receiver apprehension and social context dimensions of communication apprehension. <em class="emphasis">Speech Teacher</em>, <em class="emphasis">24</em>, 261–268.</span> In some situations, you might worry that the information presented will be “over your head”—too complex, technical, or advanced for you to understand adequately.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s03_s04_p02">Many students will actually avoid registering for courses in which they feel certain they will do poorly. In other cases, students will choose to take a challenging course only if it’s a requirement. This avoidance might be understandable but is not a good strategy for success. To become educated people, students should take a few courses that can shed light on areas where their knowledge is limited.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch04_s03_s04_p03">As a speaker, you can reduce listener apprehension by defining terms clearly and using simple visual aids to hold the audience’s attention. You don’t want to underestimate or overestimate your audience’s knowledge on a subject, so good audience analysis is always important. If you know your audience doesn’t have special knowledge on a given topic, you should start by defining important terms. Research has shown us that when listeners do not feel they understand a speaker’s message, their apprehension about receiving the message escalates. Imagine that you are listening to a speech about chemistry and the speaker begins talking about “colligative properties.” You may start questioning whether you’re even in the right place. When this happens, apprehension clearly interferes with a listener’s ability to accurately and competently understand a speaker’s message. As a speaker, you can lessen the listener’s apprehension by explaining that colligative properties focus on <em class="emphasis">how much</em> is dissolved in a solution, not on <em class="emphasis">what</em> is dissolved in a solution. You could also give an example that they might readily understand, such as saying that it doesn’t matter what kind of salt you use in the winter to melt ice on your driveway, what is important is how much salt you use.</p>

                <li>Listeners are often unable to accurately attend to messages because of four types of noise. Physical noise is caused by the physical setting a listener is in. Psychological noise exists within a listener’s own mind and prevents him or her from attending to a speaker’s message. Physiological noise exists because a listener’s body is feeling some sensation that prevents him or her from attending to a speaker’s message. Semantic noise is caused by a listener’s confusion over the meanings of words used by a speaker.</li>
                <li>All audiences have a limited attention span. As a speaker, you must realize how long you can reasonably expect an audience to listen to your message.</li>
                <li>Listeners must be aware of the biases they have for speakers and the topics speakers choose. Biases can often prevent a listener from accurately and competently listening to a speaker’s actual message.</li>
                <li>Receiver apprehension is the fear that a listener might be unable to understand the message, process the information correctly, or adapt thinking to include new information coherently. Speakers need to make sure their messages are appropriate to the audience’s knowledge level and clearly define and explain all terms that could lead to increased anxiety.</li>
