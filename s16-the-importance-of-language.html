    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_p01">When we use the word “language,” we are referring to the words you choose to use in your speech—so by definition, our focus is on spoken language. Spoken language has always existed prior to written language. Wrench, McCroskey, and Richmond suggested that if you think about the human history of language as a twelve-inch ruler, written language or recorded language has only existed for the “last quarter of an inch.”<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn13_006">Wrench, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p02">In today’s world, effective use of language helps us in our interpersonal relationships at home and at work. Using language effectively also will improve your ability to be an effective public speaker. Because language is an important aspect of public speaking that many students don’t spend enough time developing, we encourage you to take advantage of this chapter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p03">One of the first components necessary for understanding language is to understand how we assign meaning to words. Words consist of sounds (oral) and shapes (written) that have agreed-upon meanings based in concepts, ideas, and memories. When we write the word “blue,” we may be referring to a portion of the visual spectrum dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 440–490 nanometers. You could also say that the color in question is an equal mixture of both red and green light. While both of these are technically correct ways to interpret the word “blue,” we’re pretty sure that neither of these definitions is how you thought about the word. When hearing the word “blue,” you may have thought of your favorite color, the color of the sky on a spring day, or the color of a really ugly car you saw in the parking lot. When people think about language, there are two different types of meanings that people must be aware of: denotative and connotative.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Denotative Meaning</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Denotative meaning</a><span class="glossdef">The common agreed-upon meaning of a word that is often found in dictionaries.</span></span> is the specific meaning associated with a word. We sometimes refer to denotative meanings as dictionary definitions. The definitions provided above for the word “blue” are examples of definitions that might be found in a dictionary. The first dictionary was written by Robert Cawdry in 1604 and was called <em class="emphasis">Table Alphabeticall</em>. This dictionary of the English language consisted of three thousand commonly spoken English words. Today, the <em class="emphasis">Oxford English Dictionary</em> contains more than 200,000 words.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn13_010">Oxford University Press. (2011).

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Conotative Meaning</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Connotative meaning</a><span class="glossdef">An individual’s perception suggested by or associated with a word.</span></span> is the idea suggested by or associated with a word. In addition to the examples above, the word “blue” can evoke many other ideas:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>State of depression (feeling blue)</li>
                <li>Indication of winning (a blue ribbon)</li>
                <li>Side during the Civil War (blues vs. grays)</li>
                <li>Sudden event (out of the blue)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s02_p02">We also associate the color blue with the sky and the ocean. Maybe your school’s colors or those of your archrival include blue. There are also various forms of blue: aquamarine, baby blue, navy blue, royal blue, and so on.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s02_p03">Some miscommunication can occur over denotative meanings of words. For example, one of the authors of this book recently received a flyer for a tennis center open house. The expressed goal was to introduce children to the game of tennis. At the bottom of the flyer, people were encouraged to bring their own racquets if they had them but that “a limited number of racquets will be available.” It turned out that the denotative meaning of the final phrase was interpreted in multiple ways: some parents attending the event perceived it to mean that loaner racquets would be available for use during the open house event, but the people running the open house intended it to mean that parents could purchase racquets onsite. The confusion over denotative meaning probably hurt the tennis center, as some parents left the event feeling they had been misled by the flyer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s02_p04">Although denotatively based misunderstanding such as this one do happen, the majority of communication problems involving language occur because of differing connotative meanings. You may be trying to persuade your audience to support public funding for a new professional football stadium in your city, but if mentioning the team’s or owner’s name creates negative connotations in the minds of audience members, you will not be very persuasive. The potential for misunderstanding based in connotative meaning is an additional reason why audience analysis, discussed earlier in this book, is critically important. By conducting effective audience analysis, you can know in advance how your audience might respond to the connotations of the words and ideas you present. Connotative meanings can not only differ between individuals interacting at the same time but also differ greatly across time periods and cultures. Ultimately, speakers should attempt to have a working knowledge of how their audiences could potentially interpret words and ideas to minimize the chance of miscommunication.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Twelve Ways Oral and Written Language Differ</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s02_p01">A second important aspect to understand about language is that oral language (used in public speaking) and written language (used for texts) does not function the same way. Try a brief experiment. Take a textbook, maybe even this one, and read it out loud. When the text is read aloud, does it sound conversational? Probably not. Public speaking, on the other hand, should sound like a conversation. McCroskey, Wrench, and Richmond highlighted the following twelve differences that exist between oral and written language:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>Oral language has a smaller variety of words.</li>
            <li>Oral language has words with fewer syllables.</li>
            <li>Oral language has shorter sentences.</li>
            <li>Oral language has more self-reference words (<em class="emphasis">I</em>, <em class="emphasis">me</em>, <em class="emphasis">mine</em>).</li>
            <li>Oral language has fewer quantifying terms or precise numerical words.</li>
            <li>Oral language has more pseudoquantifying terms (<em class="emphasis">many</em>, <em class="emphasis">few</em>, <em class="emphasis">some</em>).</li>
            <li>Oral language has more extreme and superlative words (<em class="emphasis">none</em>, <em class="emphasis">all</em>, <em class="emphasis">every</em>, <em class="emphasis">always</em>, <em class="emphasis">never</em>).</li>
            <li>Oral language has more qualifying statements (clauses beginning with <em class="emphasis">unless</em> and <em class="emphasis">except</em>).</li>
            <li>Oral language has more repetition of words and syllables.</li>
            <li>Oral language uses more contractions.</li>
            <li>Oral language has more interjections (“Wow!,” “Really?,” “No!,” “You’re kidding!”).</li>
            <li>Oral language has more colloquial and nonstandard words.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn13_011">McCroskey, J. C., Wrench, J. S., &amp; Richmond, V. P. (2003). <em class="emphasis">Principles of public speaking</em>. Indianapolis, IN: The College Network.</span>
</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s01_s02_p02">These differences exist primarily because people listen to and read information differently. First, when you read information, if you don’t grasp content the first time, you have the ability to reread a section. When we are listening to information, we do not have the ability to “rewind” life and relisten to the information. Second, when you read information, if you do not understand a concept, you can look up the concept in a dictionary or online and gain the knowledge easily. However, we do not always have the ability to walk around with the Internet and look up concepts we don’t understand. Therefore, oral communication should be simple enough to be easily understood in the moment by a specific audience, without additional study or information.</p>

                <li>Language is important in every aspect of our lives because it allows people to communicate in a manner that enables the sharing of common ideas.</li>
                <li>Denotative definitions are the agreed-upon meanings of words that are often found in dictionaries, whereas connotative definitions involve individual perceptions of words.</li>
                <li>Misunderstandings commonly occur when the source of a message intends one denotative or connotative meaning and the receiver of the message applies a different denotative or connotative meaning to the same word or words.</li>
                <li>Oral language is designed to be listened to and to sound conversational, which means that word choice must be simpler, more informal, and more repetitive. Written language uses a larger vocabulary and is more formal.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_p01">When considering how to use language effectively in your speech, consider the degree to which the language is appropriate, vivid, inclusive, and familiar. The next sections define each of these aspects of language and discuss why each is important in public speaking.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Use Appropriate Language</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p01">As with anything in life, there are positive and negative ways of using language. One of the first concepts a speaker needs to think about when looking at language use is appropriateness. By appropriate, we mean whether the language is suitable or fitting for ourselves, as the speaker; our audience; the speaking context; and the speech itself.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Appropriate for the Speaker</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s01_p01">One of the first questions to ask yourself is whether the language you plan on using in a speech fits with your own speaking pattern. Not all language choices are appropriate for all speakers. The language you select should be suitable for you, not someone else. If you’re a first-year college student, there’s no need to force yourself to sound like an astrophysicist even if you are giving a speech on new planets. One of the biggest mistakes novice speakers make is thinking that they have to use million-dollar words because it makes them sound smarter. Actually, million-dollar words don’t tend to function well in oral communication to begin with, so using them will probably make you uncomfortable as a speaker. Also, it may be difficult for you or the audience to understand the nuances of meaning when you use such words, so using them can increase the risk of denotative or connotative misunderstandings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Appropriate for the Audience</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p01">The second aspect of appropriateness asks whether the language you are choosing is appropriate for your specific audience. Let’s say that you’re an engineering student. If you’re giving a presentation in an engineering class, you can use language that other engineering students will know. On the other hand, if you use that engineering vocabulary in a public speaking class, many audience members will not understand you. As another example, if you are speaking about the Great Depression to an audience of young adults, you can’t assume they will know the meaning of terms like “New Deal” and “WPA,” which would be familiar to an audience of senior citizens. In other chapters of this book, we have explained the importance of audience analysis; once again, audience analysis is a key factor in choosing the language to use in a speech.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Appropriate for the Context</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s03_p01">The next question about appropriateness is whether the language you will use is suitable or fitting for the context itself. The language you may employ if you’re addressing a student assembly in a high school auditorium will differ from the language you would use at a business meeting in a hotel ballroom. If you’re giving a speech at an outdoor rally, you cannot use the same language you would use in a classroom. Recall that the speaking context includes the occasion, the time of day, the mood of the audience, and other factors in addition to the physical location. Take the entire speaking context into consideration when you make the language choices for your speech.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s04_p01">The fourth and final question about the appropriateness of language involves whether the language is appropriate for your specific topic. If you are speaking about the early years of The Walt Disney Company, would you want to refer to Walt Disney as a “thaumaturgic” individual (i.e., one who works wonders or miracles)? While the word “thaumaturgic” may be accurate, is it the most appropriate for the topic at hand? As another example, if your speech topic is the dual residence model of string theory, it makes sense to expect that you will use more sophisticated language than if your topic was a basic introduction to the physics of, say, sound or light waves.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p01">After appropriateness, the second main guideline for using language is to use vivid language. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Vivid language</a><span class="glossdef">Language that helps a listener create strong, distinct, or clearly perceptible mental images.</span></span> helps your listeners create strong, distinct, clear, and memorable mental images.

Two common ways to make your speaking more vivid are through the use of imagery and rhythm.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Imagery</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Imagery</a><span class="glossdef">The use of language to represent objects, actions, or ideas.</span></span> is the use of language to represent objects, actions, or ideas. The goal of imagery is to help an audience member create a mental picture of what a speaker is saying. A speaker who uses imagery successfully will tap into one or more of the audience’s five basic senses (hearing, taste, touch, smell, and sight). Three common tools of imagery are concreteness, simile, and metaphor.</p>
            <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Concreteness</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s01_p01">When we use language that is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">concrete</a><span class="glossdef">Language that helps an audience see specific realities or actual instances instead of abstract theories and ideas.</span></span>, we attempt to help our audiences see specific realities or actual instances instead of abstract theories and ideas. The goal of concreteness is to help you, as a speaker, show your audience something instead of just telling them. Imagine you’ve decided to give a speech on the importance of freedom. You could easily stand up and talk about the philosophical work of Rudolf Steiner, who divided the ideas of freedom into freedom of thought and freedom of action. If you’re like us, even reading that sentence can make you want to go to sleep. Instead of defining what those terms mean and discussing the philosophical merits of Steiner, you could use real examples where people’s freedom to think or freedom to behave has been stifled. For example, you could talk about how Afghani women under Taliban rule have been denied access to education, and how those seeking education have risked public flogging and even execution.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn13_012">Iacopino, V., &amp; Rasekh, Z. (1998). <em class="emphasis">The Taliban's war on women: A health and human rights crisis in Afghanistan</em>. Boston, MA: Physicians for Human Rights.</span> You could further illustrate how Afghani women under the Taliban are forced to adhere to rigid interpretations of Islamic law that functionally limit their behavior. As illustrations of the two freedoms discussed by Steiner, these examples make things more concrete for audience members and thus easier to remember. Ultimately, the goal of concreteness is to show an audience something instead of talking about it abstractly.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s02_p01">The second form of imagery is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">simile</a><span class="glossdef">Figure of speech in which two unlike things are explicitly compared using “like” or “as.”</span></span>. As you probably learned in English courses, a simile is a figure of speech in which two unlike things are explicitly compared. Both aspects being compared within a simile are able to remain separate within the comparison. The following are some examples:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s02_l01">
                    <li>The thunderous applause was <em class="emphasis">like</em> a party among the gods.</li>
                    <li>After the revelation, she was as angry <em class="emphasis">as</em> a raccoon caught in a cage.</li>
                    <li>Love is <em class="emphasis">like</em> a battlefield.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s02_p02">When we look at these two examples, you’ll see that two words have been italicized: “like” and “as.” All similes contain either “like” or “as” within the comparison. Speakers use similes to help an audience understand a specific characteristic being described within the speech. In the first example, we are connecting the type of applause being heard to something supernatural, so we can imagine that the applause was huge and enormous. Now think how you would envision the event if the simile likened the applause to a mime convention—your mental picture changes dramatically, doesn’t it?</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s02_p03">To effectively use similes within your speech, first look for instances where you may already be finding yourself using the words “like” or “as”—for example, “his breath smelled like a fishing boat on a hot summer day.” Second, when you find situations where you are comparing two things using “like” or “as,” examine what it is that you are actually comparing. For example, maybe you’re comparing someone’s breath to the odor of a fishing vessel. Lastly, once you see what two ideas you are comparing, check the mental picture for yourself. Are you getting the kind of mental image you desire? Is the image too strong? Is the image too weak? You can always alter the image to make it stronger or weaker depending on what your aim is.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Metaphor</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_p01">The other commonly used form of imagery is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">metaphor</a><span class="glossdef">Figure of speech where a term or phrase is applied to something in a nonliteral way to suggest a resemblance.</span></span>, or a figure of speech where a term or phrase is applied to something in a nonliteral way to suggest a resemblance. In the case of a metaphor, one of the comparison items is said to <em class="emphasis">be</em> the other (even though this is realistically not possible). Let’s look at a few examples:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_l01">
                    <li>Love is a <em class="emphasis">battlefield</em>.</li>
                    <li>Upon hearing the charges, the accused <em class="emphasis">clammed up</em> and refused to speak without a lawyer.</li>
                    <li>Every year a new <em class="emphasis">crop</em> of activists are <em class="emphasis">born</em>.</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_p02">In these examples, the comparison word has been italicized. Let’s think through each of these examples. In the first one, the comparison is the same as one of our simile examples except that the word “like” is omitted—instead of being <em class="emphasis">like</em> a battlefield, the metaphor states that love <em class="emphasis">is</em> a battlefield, and it is understood that the speaker does not mean the comparison literally. In the second example, the accused “clams up,” which means that the accused refused to talk in the same way a clam’s shell is closed. In the third example, we refer to activists as “crops” that arise anew with each growing season, and we use “born” figuratively to indicate that they come into being—even though it is understood that they are not newborn infants at the time when they become activists.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_p03">To use a metaphor effectively, first determine what you are trying to describe. For example, maybe you are talking about a college catalog that offers a wide variety of courses. Second, identify what it is that you want to say about the object you are trying to describe. Depending on whether you want your audience to think of the catalog as good or bad, you’ll use different words to describe it. Lastly, identify the other object you want to compare the first one to, which should mirror the intentions in the second step. Let’s look at two possible metaphors:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_l02">
                    <li>Students <em class="emphasis">groped</em> their way through the <em class="emphasis">maze</em> of courses in the catalog.</li>
                    <li>Students <em class="emphasis">feasted on</em> the <em class="emphasis">abundance</em> of courses in the catalog.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_p04">While both of these examples evoke comparisons with the course catalog, the first example is clearly more negative and the second is more positive.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_p05">One mistake people often make in using metaphors is to make two incompatible comparisons in the same sentence or line of thought. Here is an example:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_s03_l03">

            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p01">Our second guideline for effective language in a speech is to use rhythm. When most people think of rhythm, they immediately think about music. What they may not realize is that language is inherently musical; at least it can be. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Rhythm</a><span class="glossdef">The patterned, recurring variance of elements of sound or speech.</span></span> refers to the patterned, recurring variance of elements of sound or speech. Whether someone is striking a drum with a stick or standing in front of a group speaking, rhythm is an important aspect of human communication. Think about your favorite public speaker. If you analyze his or her speaking pattern, you’ll notice that there is a certain cadence to the speech. While much of this cadence is a result of the nonverbal components of speaking, some of the cadence comes from the language that is chosen as well. Let’s examine four types of rhythmic language: parallelism, repetition, alliteration, and assonance.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_s01_p01">When listing items in a sequence, audiences will respond more strongly when those ideas are presented in a grammatically parallel fashion, which is referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">parallelism</a><span class="glossdef">Presenting ideas in a grammatically parallel fashion.</span></span>. For example, look at the following two examples and determine which one sounds better to you:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_s01_l01">

                    <li>“Give me liberty or give me death.”</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_s01_p02">Technically, you’re saying the same thing in both, but the second one has better rhythm, and this rhythm comes from the parallel construction of “give me.” The lack of parallelism in the first example makes the sentence sound disjointed and ineffective.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_s02_p01">As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, one of the major differences between oral and written language is the use of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">repetition</a><span class="glossdef">The oral linguistic device where key words or phrases are repeated in an attempt to help audience members recall the words or phrases after the speech.</span></span>. Because speeches are communicated orally, audience members need to hear the core of the message repeated consistently. Repetition as a linguistic device is designed to help audiences become familiar with a short piece of the speech as they hear it over and over again. By repeating a phrase during a speech, you create a specific rhythm. Probably the most famous and memorable use of repetition within a speech is Martin Luther King Jr.’s use of “I have a dream” in his speech at the Lincoln Memorial on August 1963 during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. In that speech, Martin Luther King Jr. repeated the phrase “I have a dream” eight times to great effect.</p>

While rhymes like “free as a breeze,” “mad as a hatter,” and “no pain, no gain” are examples of assonance, speakers should be wary of relying on assonance because when it is overused it can quickly turn into bad poetry.</p>

Consider the statement, “Every morning when an officer of the law puts on his badge, he risks his life to serve and protect his fellow citizens.” In this case, we have a police officer that is labeled as male four different times in one sentence. Obviously, both male and female police officers risk their lives when they put on their badges. A better way to word the sentence would be, “Every morning when officers of the law put on their badges, they risk their lives to serve and protect their fellow citizens.” Notice that in the better sentence, we made the subject plural (“officers”) and used neutral pronouns (“they” and “their”) to avoid the generic “he.”</p>

For example, within the United States we have numerous ethnic groups, including Italian Americans, Irish Americans, Japanese Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Cuban Americans, and Mexican Americans. As with the earlier example of “male nurse,” avoid statements such as “The committee is made up of four women and a Vietnamese man.” Instead, say, “The committee is made up of four women and a man” or, if race and ethnicity are central to the discussion, “The committee is made up of three European American women, an Israeli American woman, a Brazilian American woman, and a Vietnamese American man.” In recent years, there has been a trend toward steering inclusive language away from broad terms like “Asians” and “Hispanics” because these terms are not considered precise labels for the groups they actually represent. If you want to be safe, the best thing you can do is ask a couple of people who belong to an ethnic group how they prefer to label themselves.</p>

For example, a speaker might begin a speech by saying, “I am going to talk about the legal obligations you will have with your future husband or wife.” While this speech starts with the notion that everyone plans on getting married, which isn’t the case, it also assumes that everyone will label their significant others as either “husbands” or “wives.” Although some members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender/transexual community will use these terms, others prefer for more gender neutral terms like “spouse” and “partner.” Moreover, legal obligations for same-sex couples may be very different from those for heterosexual couples. Notice also that we have used the phrase “members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender/transexual community” instead of the more clinical-sounding term “homosexual.”</p>

            <li>Utilize the six elements of language in your own public speeches.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_p01">Language is a very important aspect of anyone’s public speaking performance. Whether a speaker uses lots of complicated words or words most people have in their vocabularies, language will determine how an audience experiences the speech. To help you think through your language choices, we are going to talk about six important elements of language and how they affect audience perceptions.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Clarity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p01">The first important element of language is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">clarity</a><span class="glossdef">The use of language to make sure a speaker’s ideas are understood by an audience, mirroring a speaker’s intent.</span></span>, or the use of language to make sure the audience understands a speaker’s ideas in the way the speaker intended. While language, or verbal communication, is only one channel we can use to transmit information, it is a channel that can lend itself to numerous problems. For example, as discussed earlier, if people have different connotative definitions for words, the audience can miss the intended meaning of a message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p02">Imagine you’re listening to a speaker talking and he or she uses the phrase, “Older female relative who became aerodynamic venison road kill,” or “Obese personification fabricated of compressed mounds of minute crystals.” If you’re like most people, these two phrases just went right over your head. We’ll give you a hint, these are two common Christmas songs. The first phrase refers to “Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,” and the second one is “Frosty the Snowman.” Notice that in both of these cases, the made-up title with all the polysyllabic words is far less clear than the commonly known one. While you are probably unlikely to deliberately distort the clarity of your speech by choosing such outlandish words to express simple thoughts, the point we are illustrating is that clear language makes a big difference in how well a message can be understood.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Economy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_p01">Another common mistake among new public speakers is thinking that more words are more impressive. In fact, the opposite is true. When people ramble on and on without actually making a point, audiences become bored and distracted. To avoid this problem, we recommend word <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">economy</a><span class="glossdef">The use of only those words necessary to accurately express your idea.</span></span>, or the use of only those words necessary to accurately express your idea. If the fundamental idea you are trying to say is, “that stinks,” then saying something like “while the overall outcome may be undesirable and definitely not recommended” becomes overkill. We do have one caveat here: you want to make sure that your language isn’t so basic that it turns off your audience. If you are speaking to adults and use vocabulary appropriate for school children, you’ll end up offending your audience. So while economy is definitely important, you don’t want to become so overly basic that you are perceived as “talking down” to your audience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Obscenity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s03_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Obscenity</a><span class="glossdef">Language that contains curse words or pornographic references.</span></span>, or indecent language, consists of curse words or pornographic references. While it may be fun to use obscene language in casual conversations with your friends, we cannot recommend using obscene language while delivering a speech. Even if you’re giving a speech related to an obscene word, you must be careful with your use of the word itself. Whether we agree with societal perceptions of obscenity, going out of our way to use obscenity will end up focusing the audience on the obscenity and not on our message.</p>

    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Obscure Language/Jargon</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s04_p01">Obscure language and jargon are two terms that closely relate to each other. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Obscure language</a><span class="glossdef">Language choices that are not typically understood or known by most of your audience.</span></span> refers to language choices that are not typically understood or known by most of your audience. Imagine you’re listening to a speech and the speaker says, “Today I’ve given you a plethora of ideas for greening your workplace.” While you may think the word “plethora” is commonly known, we can assure you that many people have no idea that plethora means many or an abundance of something. Similarly, you may think most people know what it means to “green” a workplace, but in fact many people do not know that it means to make the workplace more environmentally friendly, or to reduce its impact on the environment. In the case of this example, plethora simply means the speaker has given many ideas for greening the workplace. You can still use the word “plethora,” but you should include a definition so that you’re sure all of your audience will understand.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s04_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Jargon</a><span class="glossdef">Language that is commonly used by a highly specialized group, trade, or profession.</span></span>, on the other hand, refers to language that is commonly used by a highly specialized group, trade, or profession. For example there is legal jargon, or the language commonly used by and understood by lawyers. There is also medical jargon, or the language commonly used by and understood by health care practitioners. Every group, trade, or profession will have its own specific jargon. The problem that occurs for many speakers is not realizing that jargon is group, trade, or profession specific and not universal. One common form of jargon is the acronym, a word formed by taking the first letters or groups of letters of words, such as NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations), PET (positron emission tomography) scan, or IHOP (International House of Pancakes). Another form of jargon is initialism, formed by pronouncing the initials rather than the name of an organization or other entity. For example, CDC stands for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fMRI stands for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and B of A stands for Bank of America. In political discussions, you may come across various CFRs, or Codes of Federal Regulations. If you are going to use a specific acronym or initialism within your speech, you need to explain it the first time you use it. For example, you could say,</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s04_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s04_p03">According to the United States Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, employment discrimination in the Department of Homeland Security is not allowed based on biological sex, religion, sexual orientation, or race. Furthermore, the US CFR does not permit discrimination in receiving contracts based on biological sex, religion, sexual orientation, or race.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s04_p04">By defining the jargon upon first mention, we are subsequently able to use the jargon because we can be certain the audience now understands the term.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch13_s03_s06_p01">The last important aspect of language is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">variety</a><span class="glossdef">A speaker’s ability to use and implement a range of different language choices.</span></span>, or a speaker’s ability to use and implement a range of different language choices. In many ways, variety encompasses all the characteristics of language previously discussed in this chapter. Often speakers find one language device and then beat it into the ground like a railroad spike. Unfortunately, when a speaker starts using the same language device too often, the language device will start to lose the power that it may have had. For this reason, we recommend that you always think about the language you plan on using in a speech and make sure that you use a range of language choices.</p>

                <li>Public speakers need to make sure that they are very aware of their language. Six common language issues that impact public speakers are clarity, economy, obscenity, obscure language/jargon, power, and variety.</li>
                <li>When public speakers prepare their speeches, they need to make sure that their speeches contain clear language, use as few words as possible to get their point across, avoid obscenity, be careful with obscure language/jargon, use powerful language, and include variety.</li>

                <li>Find a written copy of a speech at least one page in length (Vital Speeches of the Day is an excellent source for this exercise). Summarize the speech accurately and completely in one paragraph. Then reduce your summary to twenty words. How did you go about changing your language for greater economy of word use?</li>
