        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p01">The first way to find a good topic is to conduct what we call a personal inventory. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personal inventory</a><span class="glossdef">A detailed and descriptive list about an individual.</span></span> is a detailed and descriptive list about an individual. In this case, we want you to think about you. Here are some basic questions to get you started:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p02">It is important to realize that your goal in looking at best-seller lists is not to choose a book to serve as the topic of your speech—unless you’ve been assigned to give a book review! The point is that while all these lists indicate what people are reading, you can use them to find out what topics people are generally interested in right now.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_s02_p01">In addition to numerous sources for best sellers, there are also a number of polling organizations that regularly conduct research on the American public. Not only are these organizations good for finding interesting research, but generally the most recent polls are an indication of what people are interested in understanding today. For example, The Gallup Organization regularly conducts polls to find out Americans’ perceptions of current political issues, business issues, social issues, and a whole range of other interesting information. Often just looking at the Gallup Organization’s website can help you find very interesting speech topics.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Media Outlets</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_s03_p01">The next great ways to find interesting topics for your speeches are watching television and listening to the radio. The evening news, the History Channel, and the National Geographic channel can all provide ideas for many different speech topics. There are even a host of television shows that broadcast the latest and most interesting topics weekly (e.g., <em class="emphasis">Dateline</em>, <em class="emphasis">20/20</em>, <em class="emphasis">60 Minutes</em>). Here are some recent segments from <em class="emphasis">20/20</em> that could make interesting speeches: former <em class="emphasis">Tarzan</em> actor, Steve Sipek, has lived with tigers for forty years; the science behind the <em class="emphasis">Bachelor</em> phenomenon; the world of childhood schizophrenia; and a girl born with a rare “mermaid” condition.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_s03_p02">As for listening to the radio, talk radio is often full of interesting possibilities for speech topics. Many of the most prominent talk radio shows have two or three hours to fill five days a week, so the shows’ producers are always looking for interesting topics. Why not let those producers do the investigative work for you? If you’re listening to talk radio and hear an interesting topic, write it down and think about using it for your next speech.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_s03_p03">As with the best-seller list, it is important to realize that your goal is not to use a given television or radio program as the basis for your speech, much less to repeat the exact arguments that a talk radio host or caller has made. We are not advocating stealing someone’s ideas—you need to do your own thinking to settle on your speech topic. You can certainly use ideas from the media as contributions to your speech; however, if you do this, it is only ethical to make sure that you correctly cite the show where you heard about the topic by telling your audience the title, station, and date when you heard it.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_s04_p01">You can, of course, also look for interesting speech topics online. While the Internet may not always provide the most reliable information, it is a rich source of interesting topics. For example, to browse many interesting blogs, check out <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.blogcatalog.com/">http://www.blogcatalog.com/</a> or <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.findblogs.com/">http://www.findblogs.com/</a>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_s04_p02">If you find yourself really stumped, there are even a handful of websites that specialize in helping people, just like you, find speech topics. Yes, that’s right! Some insightful individuals have posted long lists of possible topics for your next speech right on the Internet. Here are some we recommend:</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Poll Your Audience for Interests and Needs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p01">The last way you can find a great topic is to conduct a simple poll of your audience to see what their interests and needs are. Let’s handle these two methods separately. When you ask potential audience members about their interests, it’s not hard to quickly find that patterns of interests exist in every group. You can find out about interests by either formally handing people a questionnaire or just asking people casually. Suppose it’s your turn to speak at your business club’s next meeting. If you start asking your fellow club members and other local business owners if there are any specific problems their businesses are currently facing, you will probably start to see a pattern develop. While you may not be an expert on the topic initially, you can always do some research to see what experts have said on the topic and pull together a speech using that research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p02">The second type of poll you may conduct of your potential audience is what we call a needs analysis. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">needs analysis</a><span class="glossdef">A set of activities designed to determine your audience’s needs, wants, wishes, and desires.</span></span> involves a set of activities designed to determine your audience’s needs, wants, wishes, or desires. The purpose of a needs analysis is to find a gap in information that you can fill as a speaker. Again, you can use either informal or formal methods to determine where a need is. Informally, you may ask people if they have problems with something specific like writing a business plan or cooking in a wok. The only problem that can occur with the informal method is that you often find out that people overestimate their own knowledge about a topic. Someone may think they know how to use a wok even though they’ve never owned one and never cooked in one. For that reason, we often use more formal methods of assessing needs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p03">The formal process for conducting a needs analysis is threefold: (1) find a gap in knowledge, (2) figure out the cause, and (3) identify solutions. First, you need to find that a gap in knowledge actually exists. Overall, this isn’t very hard to do. You can have people try to accomplish a task or just orally have them explain a task to you, and if you find that they are lacking you’ll know that there is a possible need. Second, you need to figure out what is causing the gap. One of the mistakes that people make is assuming that all gaps exist because of a lack of information. This is not necessarily true—it can also be because of lack of experience. For example, people may have learned how to drive a car in a driver education class, but if they’ve never been behind the wheel of a car, they’re not really going to know how to drive. Would giving a speech on how to drive a car at this point be useful? No. Instead, these people need practice, not another speech. Lastly, when you determine that the major cause of the need is informational, it’s time to determine the best way to deliver that information.</p>

                <li>Conducting a personal inventory is a good way to start the topic selection process. When we analyze our own experiences, interests, knowledge, and passions, we often find topics that others will also find interesting and useful.</li>
                <li>A speaker can investigate finding aids when searching for a good topic. Various finding aids have their positives and negatives, so we recommend investigating several different finding aids to see what topic ideas inspire you.</li>
                <li>One way to ensure a successful speech is to identify your audience’s interests or needs. When the speaker’s topic is immediately useful for the audience, the audience will listen to the speech and appreciate it.</li>

                <li>Look at the questions posed in this chapter related to conducting a personal inventory. Do you see any potential speech ideas developing from your personal inventory? If yes, which one do you think would impact your audience the most?</li>
                <li>Take a broad subject area and then use two of the different finding aids to see what types of topics appear. Are you finding similarities or differences? The goal of this activity is to demonstrate how taking a very broad topic can be narrowed down to a more manageable topic using finding aids.</li>
                <li>For an upcoming speech in your public speaking class, create a simple survey to determine your audience’s needs. Find out what your audience may find interesting. Remember, the goal is to find out what your audience needs, not necessarily what you think your audience needs.</li>
