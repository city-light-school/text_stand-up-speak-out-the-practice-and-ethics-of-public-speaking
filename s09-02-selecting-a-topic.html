    <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_p01">One of the most common stumbling blocks for novice public speakers is selecting their first speech topic. Generally, your public speaking instructor will provide you with some fairly specific parameters to make this a little easier. You may be assigned to tell about an event that has shaped your life or to demonstrate how to do something. Whatever your basic parameters, at some point you as the speaker will need to settle on a specific topic. In this section, we’re going to look at some common constraints of public speaking, picking a broad topic area, and narrowing your topic.</p>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Common Constraints of Public Speaking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p01">When we use the word “constraint” with regard to public speaking, we are referring to any limitation or restriction you may have as a speaker. Whether in a classroom situation or in the boardroom, speakers are typically given specific instructions that they must follow. These instructions constrain the speaker and limit what the speaker can say. For example, in the professional world of public speaking, speakers are often hired to speak about a specific topic (e.g., time management, customer satisfaction, entrepreneurship). In the workplace, a supervisor may assign a subordinate to present certain information in a meeting. In these kinds of situations, when a speaker is hired or assigned to talk about a specific topic, he or she cannot decide to talk about something else.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p02">Furthermore, the speaker may have been asked to speak for an hour, only to show up and find out that the event is running behind schedule, so the speech must now be made in only thirty minutes. Having prepared sixty minutes of material, the speaker now has to determine what stays in the speech and what must go. In both of these instances, the speaker is constrained as to what he or she can say during a speech. Typically, we refer to four primary constraints: purpose, audience, context, and time frame.</p>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Purpose</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p01">The first major constraint someone can have involves the general purpose of the speech. As mentioned earlier, there are three general purposes: to inform, to persuade, and to entertain. If you’ve been told that you will be delivering an informative speech, you are automatically constrained from delivering a speech with the purpose of persuading or entertaining. In most public speaking classes, this is the first constraint students will come in contact with because generally teachers will tell you the exact purpose for each speech in the class.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Audience</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p01">The second major constraint that you need to consider as a speaker is the type of audience you will have. As discussed in the chapter on audience analysis, different audiences have different political, religious, and ideological leanings. As such, choosing a speech topic for an audience that has a specific mindset can be very tricky. Unfortunately, choosing what topics may or may not be appropriate for a given audience is based on generalizations about specific audiences. For example, maybe you’re going to give a speech at a local meeting of Democratic leaders. You may think that all Democrats are liberal or progressive, but there are many conservative Democrats as well. If you assume that all Democrats are liberal or progressive, you may end up offending your audience by making such a generalization without knowing better. Obviously, the best way to prevent yourself from picking a topic that is inappropriate for a specific audience is to really know your audience, which is why we recommend conducting an audience analysis, as described in <a class="xref" href="wrench_1.0-ch05#wrench_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Audience Analysis"</a>.</p>

        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Context</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s03_p01">The third major constraint relates to the context. For speaking purposes, the context of a speech is the set of circumstances surrounding a particular speech. There are countless different contexts in which we can find ourselves speaking: a classroom in college, a religious congregation, a corporate boardroom, a retirement village, or a political convention. In each of these different contexts, the expectations for a speaker are going to be unique and different. The topics that may be appropriate in front of a religious group may not be appropriate in the corporate boardroom. Topics appropriate for the corporate boardroom may not be appropriate at a political convention.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Time Frame</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s04_p01">The last—but by no means least important—major constraint that you will face is the time frame of your speech. In speeches that are under ten minutes in length, you must narrowly focus a topic to one major idea. For example, in a ten-minute speech, you could not realistically hope to discuss the entire topic of the US Social Security program. There are countless books, research articles, websites, and other forms of media on the topic of Social Security, so trying to crystallize all that information into ten minutes is just not realistic.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s04_p02">Instead, narrow your topic to something that is more realistically manageable within your allotted time. You might choose to inform your audience about Social Security disability benefits, using one individual disabled person as an example. Or perhaps you could speak about the career of Robert J. Myers, one of the original architects of Social Security.<span class="footnote" id="wrench_1.0-fn06_007">See, for example, Social Security Administration (1996). Robert J. Myers oral history interview. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/myersorl.html">http://www.ssa.gov/history/myersorl.html</a></span> By focusing on information that can be covered within your time frame, you are more likely to accomplish your goal at the end of the speech.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Selecting a Broad Subject Area</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_p01">Once you know what the basic constraints are for your speech, you can then start thinking about picking a topic. The first aspect to consider is what subject area you are interested in examining. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">subject area</a><span class="glossdef">A broad area of knowledge (e.g., art, business, history, physical sciences, social sciences, humanities, education).</span></span> is a broad area of knowledge. Art, business, history, physical sciences, social sciences, humanities, and education are all examples of subject areas. When selecting a topic, start by casting a broad net because it will help you limit and weed out topics quickly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_p02">Furthermore, each of these broad subject areas has a range of subject areas beneath it. For example, if we take the subject area “art,” we can break it down further into broad categories like art history, art galleries, and how to create art. We can further break down these broad areas into even narrower subject areas (e.g., art history includes prehistoric art, Egyptian art, Grecian art, Roman art, Middle Eastern art, medieval art, Asian art, Renaissance art, modern art). As you can see, topic selection is a narrowing process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Narrowing Your Topic</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s03_p01">Narrowing your topic to something manageable for the constraints of your speech is something that takes time, patience, and experience. One of the biggest mistakes that new public speakers make is not narrowing their topics sufficiently given the constraints. In the previous section, we started demonstrating how the narrowing process works, but even in those examples, we narrowed subject areas down to fairly broad areas of knowledge.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s03_p02">Think of narrowing as a funnel. At the top of the funnel are the broad subject areas, and your goal is to narrow your topic further and further down until just one topic can come out the other end of the funnel. The more focused your topic is, the easier your speech is to research, write, and deliver. So let’s take one of the broad areas from the art subject area and keep narrowing it down to a manageable speech topic. For this example, let’s say that your general purpose is to inform, you are delivering the speech in class to your peers, and you have five to seven minutes. Now that we have the basic constraints, let’s start narrowing our topic. The broad area we are going to narrow in this example is Middle Eastern art. When examining the category of Middle Eastern art, the first thing you’ll find is that Middle Eastern art is generally grouped into four distinct categories: Anatolian, Arabian, Mesopotamian, and Syro-Palestinian. Again, if you’re like us, until we started doing some research on the topic, we had no idea that the historic art of the Middle East was grouped into these specific categories. We’ll select Anatolian art, or the art of what is now modern Turkey.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s03_p03">You may think that your topic is now sufficiently narrow, but even within the topic of Anatolian art, there are smaller categories: pre-Hittite, Hittite, Uratu, and Phrygian periods of art. So let’s narrow our topic again to the Phrygian period of art (1200–700 BCE). Although we have now selected a specific period of art history in Anatolia, we are still looking at a five-hundred-year period in which a great deal of art was created. One famous Phrygian king was King Midas, who according to myth was given the ears of a donkey and the power of a golden touch by the Greek gods. As such, there is an interesting array of art from the period of Midas and its Greek counterparts representing Midas. At this point, we could create a topic about how Phrygian and Grecian art differed in their portrayals of King Midas. We now have a topic that is unique, interesting, and definitely manageable in five to seven minutes. You may be wondering how we narrowed the topic down; we just started doing a little research using the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s website (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.metmuseum.org">http://www.metmuseum.org</a>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s03_p04">Overall, when narrowing your topic, you should start by asking yourself four basic questions based on the constraints discussed earlier in this section:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="wrench_1.0-ch06_s02_s03_l01">
            <li>Does the topic match my intended general purpose?</li>
            <li>Is the topic appropriate for my audience?</li>
            <li>Is the topic appropriate for the given speaking context?</li>
            <li>Can I reasonably hope to inform or persuade my audience in the time frame I have for the speech?</li>
        </ol>

                <li>Selecting a topic is a process. We often start by selecting a broad area of knowledge and then narrowing the topic to one that is manageable for a given rhetorical situation.</li>
                <li>When finalizing a specific purpose for your speech, always ask yourself four basic questions: (1) Does the topic match my intended general purpose?; (2) Is the topic appropriate for my audience?; (3) Is the topic appropriate for the given speaking context?; and (4) Can I reasonably hope to inform or persuade my audience in the time frame I have for the speech?</li>
